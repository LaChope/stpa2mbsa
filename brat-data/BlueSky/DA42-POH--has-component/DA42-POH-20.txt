2.9    APPROVED MANEUVERS
The airplane is certified in the Normal Category in accordance with JAR-23.
Approved Maneuvers
    1)  All normal flight maneuvers;
   2)  Stalling (with the exception of dynamic stalling); and
   3)  Lazy Eights, Chandelles, as well as steep turns and similar maneuvers, in which
       an angle of bank of not more than 60° is attained.
                                       CAUTION
              Aerobatics, spinning and flight maneuvers with more than 60°
              of bank are not permitted in the Normal Category. Stalling
              with  asymmetric  power  or  one  engine  inoperative  is  not
              permitted.

2.10  MANEUVERING LOAD FACTORS
                                        NOTE
              The tables below show structural limitations. The load factor
              limits for the TAE 125 engine must also be observed. Refer
              to the corresponding Operation & Maintenance Manual for
              the engine.
                                      CAUTION
              Avoid extended negative g-loads duration. Extended negative
              g-loads can cause propeller control problems and engine
              surging.

                                     WARNING
              Exceeding the maximum structural load factors will lead to
              overstressing of the airplane.
                                      CAUTION
              Exceeding the maximum powerplant load factors and time
              limits listed below will lead to a L/R OIL PRES warning.

           navigation aid, and the required navigation aid must be operational.
    (e)    VNAV information may be utilized for advisory information only. Use of VNAV
           information for Instrument Approach Procedures does not guarantee step-down
           fix altitude protection, or arrival at approach minimums in normal position to land.
    (f)    RNAV (GPS) approaches must be conducted utilizing the GPS sensor.
    (g)    RNP RNAV operations are not authorized, except as noted in Chapter 1 of this
          AFM.
6.  If not previously defined, the following default settings must be made in the SYSTEM
    SETUP menu of the G1000 prior to operation (refer to Pilot s Guide for procedure if
    necessary):
    (a)    DIS, SPD         :  nm, kt  (sets navigation units to "nautical miles" and "knots")
    (b)    ALT, VS          :  ft, fpm (sets altitude units to "feet" and "feet per minute")
    (c)    POSITION         :  deg-min     (sets navigation grid units to decimal minutes)
                                           NOTE
               Navigation Information is referenced to WGS-84 reference
               system, and should only be used where the Aeronautical
               Information   Publication   (including   electronic   data   and
               aeronautical charts) conforms to WGS-84 or equivalent.

7.  When AHRS is required to meet the items listed in the minimum operational equipment
    (serviceable) table in Section 2.13 - KINDS OF OPERATION, operation is prohibited
    in the following areas:
    (a)    North of 72° N latitude at all longitudes.
    (b)    South of 70° S latitude at all longitudes.
    (c)    North of 65° N latitude between longitude 75° W and 120° W (Northern Canada).
    (d)    North of 70° N latitude between longitude 70° W and 128° W (Northern Canada).
    (e)    North of 70° N latitude between longitude 85° E and 114° E (Northern Russia).
    (f)    South of 55° S latitude between longitude 120° E and 165° E (Region south
           of Australia and New Zealand).
   When day VFR operations are conducted in the above areas, the MFD must be in
    a non-Heading Up orientation.
8.  If the CDI source is changed when the autopilot is engaged in NAV mode, the autopilot
    lateral mode will revert to ROLL ATTITUDE mode and NAV mode must be manually
    reselected by the pilot.
9.  The  fuel  quantity,  fuel  required,  and  fuel  remaining  functions  on  the  Fuel  Page
    (displayed when pushing the FUEL button as shown in Section 7.13) of the FMS are
    supplemental information only and must be verified by the flight crew.
10.  The pilot s altimeter is the primary altitude  reference during all operations using
     advisory vertical navigation (VNAV) information and the autopilot. A flight altitude
     selected via the autopilot must be verified and corrected according to the indication
     of the calibrated altimeter.
11.  The availability of Safe Taxi®, ChartView, or FliteCharts® in electronic form on the
     G1000 is for information purposes only, it is still mandatory to carry another source
     of charts on-board the airplane.

2.16.7  SMOKING
Smoking in the airplane is not permitted.
2.16.8  GROUND OPERATION
Take-off and landing has been demonstrated on hard paved surfaces (asphalt, concrete,
etc.) and grass runways.
2.16.9  USE OF THE SUN VISORS
The sun visors (if installed, OÄM 42-101 or OÄM 42-142) may only be used during cruise.
During all other phases of flight the sun visors must be locked in the fully upward position.
2.16.10 STRUCTURAL TEMPERATURE
                                       CAUTION
              The max. zero fuel mass of 1650 kg (3638 lb) may only
               be exceeded if OÄM 42-188 is carried out. 
If the zero fuel mass exceeds 1650 kg (3638 lb) the maximum permissible structural
temperature of  55 °C (131 °F) must not be exceeded before flight. Temperature indicators
in the LH and RH landing gear bays indicate the structural temperature.

2.16.11 GARMIN GWX 68 WEATHER RADAR OPERATION
                                      WARNING
              The Garmin GWX 68 Weather Radar System (if installed)
              must not be operated on ground. If the system is transmitting,
              it may result in bodily injury if persons are within the minimum
              safe distance of 2.8 m (9.16 ft). Never operate the radar in
              a hangar or other enclosure as radiation can be reflected
              throughout the area.
