 Procedures
3.1    INTRODUCTION
3.1.1  GENERAL
This chapter contains checklists as well as the description of recommended procedures
to be followed in the event of an emergency. Engine failure or other airplane-related
emergencies are most unlikely to occur if the prescribed procedures for pre-flight checks
and airplane maintenance are followed.
If, nonetheless, an emergency does arise, the guidelines given in this chapter should be
followed and applied in order to clear the problem.
As it is impossible to foresee all kinds of emergencies and cover them in this Airplane
Flight Manual, a thorough understanding of the airplane by the pilot is, in addition to his
knowledge and experience, an essential factor in the solution of any problems which may
arise.
                                          WARNING
                In each emergency, control over the flight attitude and the
                preparation of a possible emergency landing have priority
                over  attempts  to  solve  the  current  problem  ("first  fly  the
                aircraft").  Prior  to  the  flight  the  pilot  must  consider  the
                suitability of the terrain for an emergency landing for each
                phase of the flight. For a safe flight the pilot must constantly
                keep a safe minimum flight altitude. Solutions for various
                adverse scenarios should be thought over in advance. This
                should prevent a situation where the pilot is faced with an
                emergency he cannot handle calmly and with determination.

3.1.3  SELECTING EMERGENCY FREQUENCY
In an in-flight emergency, depressing and holding the Com transfer button           on the
G1000 for 2 seconds will tune the emergency frequency of 121.500 MHz. If the display
is available, it will also show it in the "Active" frequency window.
