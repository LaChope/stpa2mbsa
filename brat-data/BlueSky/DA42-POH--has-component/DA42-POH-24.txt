              Loss of an annunciator may be indicated when engine or fuel
              displays show an abnormal or emergency situation and the
              annunciator is not present. An erroneous annunciator may
              be identified when an annunciator appears which does not
              agree with other displays or system information.
 1.  If an annunciator appears, treat it as if the condition exists. Refer to Chapter 3 -
     EMERGENCY PROCEDURES or Chapter 4B - ABNORMAL OPERATING
     PROCEDURES.
 2.  If a display indicates an abnormal condition but no annunciator is present, use
     other system information, such as engine displays, GPS fuel quantity and flow,
     to determine if the condition exists. If it cannot be determined that the condition
     does not exist, treat the situation as if the condition exists. Refer to Chapter 3 -
     EMERGENCY PROCEDURES or Chapter 4B - ABNORMAL OPERATING
     PROCEDURES.
