3.9    OTHER EMERGENCIES
3.9.1  SUSPICION OF CARBON MONOXIDE CONTAMINATION IN THE CABIN
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas which is developed during the combustion process. It
is poisonous and without smell. Increased concentration of carbon monoxide gas can
be fatal. The occurrence of CO in the cabin is possible only due to a defect. If a smell
similar to exhaust gases is noticed in the cabin, the following measures should be taken:
 1.   Cabin heat & defrost ____________________________ OFF
 2.  Ventilation ________________________________________ open
 3.  Emergency windows ____________________________ open
 4.  Forward canopy      _________________________________unlatch, push up and lock in
                                                          "cooling-gap“ position
                                         CAUTION
               The maximum demonstrated airspeed for emergency opening
               the  front  canopy  in  flight  is  120  KIAS.  Do  not  exceed
               120 KIAS.

3.9.3  DEFECTIVE PROPELLER RPM REGULATING SYSTEM
                                        CAUTION
               The power lever should be moved slowly, in order to avoid
               over-speeding and excessively rapid RPM changes. The light
               wooden propeller blades produce more rapid RPM changes
               than metal blades.
                                       WARNING
               In case of a malfunction of the engine control unit it is possible
               that the propeller blades will remain in the position of highest
               pitch. In this case the reduced engine performance should
               be taken into consideration.

                                             NOTE
               If MÄM 42-088 is carried out and OÄM 42-195 is not carried
               out, a landing with a mass between 1700 kg (3748 lb) and
               1785  kg  (3935  lb)  constitutes  an  abnormal  operating
               procedure.
                                             NOTE
               v  is always less than v . For the DA 42 however, the actual
                x                        y
               value of v  would be below the minimum safe speed. The
                          x
               minimum airspeed for best angle of climb was therefore raised
               to the value of v .

 Procedures
4A.4     FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS
The DA 42 is to be flown with "the feet on the pedals“, meaning that coordinated flight
in all phases and configurations shall be supported by dedicated use of the rudder and
ailerons together.
With the landing gear extended and at aft  CG-locations, with flaps up and full power
applied, the airplane will easily recover from sideslip if the trim is set to neutral (normal
procedure), otherwise it may require corrective action with a moderate amount of rudder
input.
4A.5     DAILY CHECK
Before the first flight of a day it must be ensured that the following checks are performed.
*   On-condition check of the canopy, the side door and the baggage compartment doors
    for cracks and major scratches.
*   On-condition check of the hinges for the canopy, the side door and the baggage
    compartment doors.
*   Visual inspection of the locking bolts for proper movement with no backlash.
*   Tire inflation pressure check 
       (main wheels:     4.7 bar / 68 PSI if OÄM 42-195 is installed, 
                         4.5 bar / 65 PSI if OÄM 42-195 is not installed, 
        nose wheel:      6.0 bar / 87 PSI).
*   Visual inspection of both spinners and their attachment.
*   If OÄM 42-077 (removable fuselage nose cone) is implemented: 
    Check fuselage nose cone for improper fit and loose attachment screws.

1. Transfer the first half of the auxiliary fuel:
    As soon as the fuel quantity in each main fuel tank is 17 US gal or less, set both FUEL
    TRANSFER switches to ON until the main tanks are full again.
    Monitor the fuel quantity indicator to verify that fuel is properly transferred to both main
    fuel tanks (approx. 1 US gal per minute). If the fuel quantity in a main tank does not
    increase  during  fuel  transfer,  proceed  according  to  Section  4B.11    -  L/R  FUEL
    TRANSFER FAIL.
2. Transfer the second half of the auxiliary fuel:
    Repeat the procedure described above.
                                             NOTE
                Transfer the fuel from the auxiliary tanks to the main tanks
                as soon as possible. The fuel in the auxiliary tanks must be
                transferred to the main tanks to become available for the
                current flight mission.

 Procedures
4A.6.18  FLIGHT IN RAIN
                                           NOTE
               Performance deteriorates in rain; this applies particularly to
               the take-off distance and to the maximum horizontal speed.
               The  effect  on  the  flight  characteristics  is  minimal.  Flight
               through very heavy rain should be avoided because of the
               associated visibility problems.
4A.6.19  REFUELING
                                         CAUTION
               Before refueling, the airplane must be connected to electrical
               ground. Grounding points: exhausts, left and right. Refer to
               Section 2.14 - FUEL for approved fuel grades. 
                                           NOTE
               If the airplane is operated with Diesel Fuel (only approved
               if  MÄM  42-037  is  incorporated),  additional  temperature
               limitations (refer to Section 2.16.1 - FUEL TEMPERATURE)
               must be observed.
               If Jet Fuel is used, make sure that no Diesel Fuel is remaining
               in the tanks, neither in the left nor in the right tank (see fuel
               grade,  Section  7.9.5  -  FUEL  SYSTEM).  Otherwise  the
               temperature limitations for  Diesel Fuel operation must be
               observed.

Refueling of the Auxiliary Tanks (if installed)
                                        CAUTION
               If  the  auxiliary  tanks  are  used,  then  both  tanks  must  be
               refueled to the maximum level. Only then the pilot has proper
               information concerning the fuel quantity in the auxiliary tanks.
               If the auxiliary tanks are not in use, make sure that they are
               empty (refer to Section 6.4 - FLIGHT MASS & CENTER OF
               GRAVITY).
                                        CAUTION
               If the airplane is operated with Diesel Fuel or a blend of Diesel
               Fuel  with  Jet  Fuel  (only  approved  if  MÄM  42-037  is
               incorporated), the use of the auxiliary tanks is not permitted.

4B.1     PRECAUTIONARY LANDING
                                           NOTE
               A  landing of this type is only necessary when there is a
               reasonable suspicion that due to operational factors such as
               fuel  shortage,  weather  conditions,  etc.  the  possibility  of
               endangering the airplane and its occupants by continuing the
               flight cannot be excluded. The pilot is required to decide
               whether or not a controlled landing in a field represents a
               lower risk than the attempt to reach the nearest airfield under
               all circumstances.
                                           NOTE
               If no level landing area is available, a landing on an upward
               slope should be sought.
 1.   Select appropriate landing area.
 2.  Consider wind.
 3.  Approach:
     If possible, the landing area should be overflown at a suitable height in order to
     recognize obstacles. The degree of offset at each part of the circuit will allow the
     wind speed and direction to be assessed.
 4.  ATC    ______________________________________________ advise
               Perform   procedures   according   to   Normal   Procedures
               4A.6.11 - APPROACH & LANDING.
 5.  Touchdown  _______________________________________with the lowest possible airspeed

4B.4.8  PITOT FAIL / HT OFF
 PITOT FAIL                    Pitot heating system has failed.
 PITOT HT OFF                  Pitot heating system is OFF.
 1.   PITOT HEAT _____________________________________  check ON / as required
                                             NOTE
               The Pitot heating caution message is displayed when the Pitot
                heating is switched OFF, or when there is a failure of the Pitot
                heating system. Prolonged operation of the Pitot heating on
               the ground can also cause the Pitot heating caution message
               to be displayed. In this case it indicates the activation of the
               thermal  switch,  which  prevents  overheating  of  the  Pitot
                heating system on the ground. This is a normal function of
               the system. After a cooling period, the heating system will be
               switched on again automatically.
If in icing conditions:
 2.  Expect loss of static instruments.
 3.   Open alternate static.
 4.  Leave icing zone / refer to 3.9.4 - UNINTENTIONAL FLIGHT INTO ICING.

               The STAL HT OFF caution message is displayed when the
               Pitot heating is switched OFF, or STAL HT FAIL when there
               is a failure of the stall warning heating system. Operation of
               the stall warning heating on the ground also causes the stall
               warning heating failed caution message to be displayed. In
               this case it indicates the activation of the thermal protection
               relay, which prevents overheating of the stall warning heating
               system on the ground. This is a normal function of the system.
If in icing conditions:

4B.4.11  STICK LIMIT
 STICK LIMIT                   Control stick limiting system (variable elevator stop) has
                               failed.
The variable elevator backstop is activated depending on the position of the POWER levers
and the position of the flap selector switch. The system has two failure modes which can
be identified as follows:
(a)  Both POWER levers are in a position for a power setting of more than approximately
     20 % LOAD, and the FLAP selector switch is in LDG position:
                                          CAUTION
                The variable elevator backstop is inoperative. In  case of
                stalling  with  "power-on"  the  handling  qualities  and  stall-
                characteristics are degraded significantly.
                Do not stall the airplane in any configuration.
(b)  At  least  one  POWER  lever  is  in  a  position  for  a  power  setting  of  less  than
     approximately 20 % LOAD, or the FLAP selector switch is not in LDG position:
                                          CAUTION
                The variable elevator backstop is active all the time, reducing
                the  maximum  elevator  "pull"-deflection.  This  results  in
                reduced elevator capacity. In this case it is important not to
                reduce airspeed below required minimum vREF  during the
                approach for landing, especially at loading conditions with
                forward locations of the center of gravity.
