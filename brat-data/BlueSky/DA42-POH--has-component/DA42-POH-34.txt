6.3    MASS AND BALANCE REPORT
The empty mass and the corresponding CG position established before delivery are the
first entries in the Mass and Balance Report. Every change in permanently installed
equipment, and every repair to the airplane which affects the empty mass or the empty
mass CG must be recorded in the Mass and Balance Report.
For the calculation of flight mass and corresponding CG position (or moment), the current
empty mass and the corresponding CG position (or moment) in accordance with the Mass
and Balance Report must always be used.
Condition of the airplane for establishing the empty mass:
-   Equipment as per Equipment Inventory (see Section 6.5)
-   Including the following operating fluids:
       - Brake fluid
       - Hydraulic fluid (for the retractable gear)
       - Engine oil (2 x 6.0 liter = 2 x 6.3 qts)
       - Coolant (2 x 6.0 liter = 2 x 6.3 qts)
       - Gearbox oil (2 x 0.9 liter = 2 x 0.95 qts)
       - Unusable fuel in main fuel tanks (2 x 1.0 US gal = 2 x 3.8 liter)
       - Unusable fuel in auxiliary fuel tanks (if installed, 2 x 0.5 US gal = 2 x 1.9 liter)
