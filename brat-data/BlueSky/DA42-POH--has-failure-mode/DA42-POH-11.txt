 DA 42 AFM                                                                               General
1.8     G1000 AVIONICS SYSTEM
1.  The  G1000   Integrated  Avionics   System  is  a   fully  integrated  flight,  engine,
    communication, navigation and surveillance instrumentation system. The system
    consists of a Primary Flight Display (PFD), Multi-Function Display (MFD), audio panel,
    Air Data Computer (ADC), Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS), engine
    sensors and processing unit (GEA), and integrated avionics (GIA) containing VHF
    communications, VHF navigation, and GPS (Global Positioning System).
2.  The primary function of the PFD is to provide attitude, heading, air data, navigation,
    and alerting information to the pilot. The PFD may also be used for flight planning.
    The primary function of the MFD is to provide engine information, mapping, terrain
    information, and for flight planning. The audio panel is used for selection of radios for
    transmitting and listening, intercom functions, and marker beacon functions.
3.  The primary function of the VHF Communication portion of the G1000 is to enable
    external radio communication. The primary function of the VOR/ILS Receiver portion
    of the equipment is to receive and demodulate VOR, Localizer, and Glide Slope signals.
    The primary function of the GPS portion of the system is to acquire signals from the
    GPS satellites, recover orbital data, make range and Doppler measurements, and
    process this information in real-time to obtain the user’s position, velocity, and time.
4.  Provided a Garmin G1000 GPS receiver is receiving adequate usable signals, it has
    been demonstrated capable of and has been shown to meet the accuracy specifications
    for:
    (a) VFR/IFR enroute, oceanic, terminal, and non-precision instrument approach (GPS,
        Loran-C, VOR, VOR-DME, TACAN, NDB, NDB-DME, RNAV) operation within the
        U.S. National Airspace System in accordance with AC 20-138A.

General                                                                   DA 42 AFM
  (b) The systems meets RNP5 airspace (BRNAV) requirements of AC 90-96 and in
      accordance with AC 20-138A, and FAA Order 8110.60 for oceanic and remote
      airspace operations, provided it is receiving useable navigation information from
      the GPS receiver. The system meets the accuracy requirements of EASA AMC 20-4
     for Basic RNAV.
  (c) The Garmin GNSS navigation system as installed in this airplane complies with
      the  equipment  requirements  of  FAA  AC  90-100A  for  RNAV  2  and  RNAV  1
      operations.
  (d) The Garmin GNSS navigation system as installed in this airplane complies with
      the  equipment  requirements  of  FAA  AC  90-105  and  meets  the  equipment
      performance and functional requirements to conduct RNP terminal departure and
      arrival procedures and RNP approach procedures without RF (radius to fix) legs.
      (RNP1, RNP APCH0.3 LNAV). 
  (e) The Garmin GNSS navigation system as installed in this airplane has been found
      to comply with the requirements for primary means of Class II navigation in oceanic
      and remote navigation (RNP-10) without time limitations in accordance with FAA
     AC 20-138A and FAA Order 8400.12A. The Garmin GNSS navigation system can
      be used without reliance on other long-range navigation system. 
  Navigation is accomplished using the WGS-84 (NAD-83) coordinate reference datum.
  GPS navigation data is based upon use of only the GPS operated by the United States
  of America.

5. If the Garmin GWX 68 Weather Radar System is installed, it can be used to aid the
   pilot in avoiding thunderstorms and associated turbulence or for ground mapping. The
   GWX 68 shall be used to avoid severe weather and not for penetrating severe weather.
   Pulse type weather radar systems like the GWX 68 detect precipitation only, not clouds
   or turbulence. The display may indicate clear areas between intense returns, but this
   does not necessarily mean it is safe to fly between them. As installed on the DA 42,
   the Garmin GWX 68 has a demonstrated range of 160 nautical miles. Refer to Garmin
   G1000 Pilot’s Guide for the DA 42, P/N 190-00649-04 in the latest effective issue for
   further information.
