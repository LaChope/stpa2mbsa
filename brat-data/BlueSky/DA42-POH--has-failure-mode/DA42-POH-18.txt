                                       WARNING
               Exceeding the mass limits will lead to overstressing of the
              airplane as well as to degradation of flight characteristics and
              flight performance.

DA 42 AFM                                                      Operating Limitations
                                        NOTE
             In  some countries the  beginning  of a flight is defined by
             starting the powerplant. In those countries a ramp mass of
             maximal MTOM + 8 kg (MTOM + 18 lb) is approved. At the
             time of lift-off the maximum permitted take-off mass must not
             be exceeded.
                                        NOTE
             If MÄM 42-088 is carried out and OÄM 42-195 is not carried
             out, a landing with a mass between 1700 kg (3748 lb) and
             1785  kg  (3935  lb)  constitutes  an  abnormal  operating
             procedure.
                                        NOTE
             For a zero fuel mass above 1650 kg (3638 lb) a structural
             temperature  limit  has  been  established  which  must  be
             observed before flight.
