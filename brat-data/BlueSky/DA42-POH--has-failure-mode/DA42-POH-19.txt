 Operating Limitations                                                              DA 42 AFM
2.8    CENTER OF GRAVITY
Datum Plane
The Datum Plane (DP) is a plane which is normal to the airplaneâ€™s longitudinal axis and
in front of the airplane as seen from the direction of flight. The airplane s longitudinal axis
is parallel with the floor of the nose baggage compartment. When the floor of the nose
baggage compartment is aligned horizontally, the Datum Plane is vertical. The Datum
Plane is located 2.196 meters (86.46 in) forward of the most forward point of the root rib
on the stub wing (refer to figure in Section 6.2).
Center of Gravity Limitations
The center of gravity (CG position) for flight conditions must be between the following
limits:
Most forward flight CG:
       2.35 m (92.52 in) aft of Datum Plane at 1250 kg (2756 lb)
       2.35 m (92.52 in) aft of Datum Plane at 1468 kg (3236 lb)
       2.40 m (94.49 in) aft of Datum Plane at max. take-off mass (see Section 2.7)
        linear variation in between
Most rearward flight CG:
       2.42 m (95.28 in) aft of Datum Plane at 1250 kg (2756 lb)
       2.49 m (98.03 in) aft of Datum Plane at 1600 kg (3527 lb)
       2.49 m (98.03 in) aft of Datum Plane at max. take-off mass (see Section 2.7)
        linear variation in between
Refer to Section 6.4.4 for a graphical illustration of the CG limitations.
                                          WARNING
                Exceeding  the  center  of  gravity  limitations  reduces  the
                controllability and stability of the airplane.
