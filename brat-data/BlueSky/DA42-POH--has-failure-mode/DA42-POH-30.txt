5.1    INTRODUCTION
The performance tables and diagrams on the following pages are presented so that, on
the one hand, you can see what performance you can expect from your airplane, while
on the other they allow comprehensive and sufficiently accurate flight planning. The values
in the tables and the diagrams were obtained in the framework of the flight trials using
an airplane and power-plant in good condition, and corrected to the conditions of the
International Standard Atmosphere (ISA = 15   C / 59 Â°F and 1,013.25 hPa / 29.92 inHg
at sea level).
The performance diagrams do not take into account variations in pilot experience or a
poorly maintained airplane. The performances given can be attained if the procedures
