6.4    FLIGHT MASS AND CENTER OF GRAVITY
The following information enables you to operate your DA 42 within the permissible mass
and balance limits. For the calculation of the flight mass and the corresponding CG position
the following tables and diagrams are required:
    6.4.1  - MOMENT ARMS
    6.4.2  - LOADING DIAGRAM
    6.4.3  - CALCULATION OF LOADING CONDITION
    6.4.4  - PERMISSIBLE CENTER OF GRAVITY RANGE
    6.4.5  - PERMISSIBLE MOMENT RANGE
The diagrams should be used as follows:
1.  Take the empty mass and the empty mass moment of your airplane from the Mass
    and Balance Report, and enter the figures in the appropriate boxes under the column
    marked ‘Your DA 42' in Table 6.4.3 - CALCULATION OF LOADING CONDITION.
2.  Read the fuel quantity indicators to determine the fuel quantity in the main fuel tanks.
3.  Determine the fuel quantity in the auxiliary fuel tanks (if installed).
    To verify an empty auxiliary fuel tank, set the ELECT. MASTER switch and the FUEL
    TRANSFER switch to ON and check the  PFD for the L/R AUX FUEL E caution
    message.
    To verify a full auxiliary fuel tank open the auxiliary fuel tank filler and check fuel level.
    If the auxiliary fuel tank quantity is in between empty and full, the exact quantity cannot
    be determined. If possible transfer all fuel to the main fuel tank by setting the ELECT.
    MASTER switch and the FUEL TRANSFER switch to ON until the L/R AUX FUEL E
    caution message appears on the PFD. During this procedure ground power must be
    used or at least one engine must be running. The fuel transfer will take a maximum
    of 10 minutes.

                                         CAUTION
               If the auxiliary tanks are in use, both tanks must be refueled
               to the maximum level to provide proper information for the
               pilot about the fuel quantity in the auxiliary fuel tanks. 
               If the auxiliary tanks are not in use, the pilot must ensure that
               they are empty.
4.  Multiply the individual masses by the moment arms quoted to obtain the moment for
    every item of loading and enter these moments in the appropriate boxes in Table
    6.4.3 - CALCULATION OF LOADING CONDITION.
5.  Add up the masses and moments in the respective columns. The CG position is
    calculated by dividing the total moment by the total mass (using row 8 for the condition
    with empty fuel tanks, and row 11 for the pre take-off condition). The resulting CG
    position must be inside the limits.
    As an illustration the total mass and the CG position are entered on Diagram 6.4.4 -
    PERMISSIBLE CENTER OF GRAVITY RANGE. This checks graphically that the
    current configuration of the airplane is within the permissible range.
6.  Graphical method:
    Diagram 6.4.2 - LOADING DIAGRAM is used to determine the moments. The masses
    and moments for the individual items of loading are added. Then Diagram 6.4.5 -
    PERMISSIBLE  MOMENT  RANGE  is  used  to  check  whether  the  total  moment
    associated with the total mass is in the permissible range.
    The result found with the graphical method is however inaccurate. In doubtful cases
    the result must be verified using the exact method given above.

6.4.3  CALCULATION OF LOADING CONDITION
                                            NOTE
               If the optional de-icing system (OÄM 42-053 or OÄM 42-054)
               is installed, the following must be observed:
               The consumption of fuel causes a forward movement of the
               CG. The consumption of de-icing fluid causes a rearward
               movement of the CG. Depending on the fuel flow and de-icing
               fluid flow, the overall movement of the CG can be a forward
               or a rearward movement. In order to cover all possible cases,
               the following table must be completed twice: with (as shown
               in the example) and without considering the on-board de-icing
               fluid. All four CG positions (fuel tank full/empty, de-icing fluid
               tank full/empty) must fall into the permitted area.
1.  Complete the form on the next page.
2.  Divide the total moments from rows 8 and 11 by the related total mass to obtain the
    CG positions.
    In our example:      empty tanks:      3625.1 kgm / 1527.5 kg = 2.373 m
                                           314,656 in.lb / 3368 lb = 93.43 in
                         full tanks:       4312.1 kgm / 1770.5 kg = 2.436 m
                                           374,295 in.lb / 3904 lb = 95.87 in
3.  Locate the values in the diagram in Section 6.4.4 - PERMISSIBLE CENTER OF
    GRAVITY RANGE. If the CG positions and related masses fall into the permitted area,
    the loading condition is allowable.
    Our example shows allowable loading conditions (for 1785 kg take-off mass, i.e.,
    MÄM 42-088 carried out).
