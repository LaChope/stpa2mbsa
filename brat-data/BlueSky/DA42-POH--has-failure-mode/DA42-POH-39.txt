7.3    FLIGHT CONTROLS 
The ailerons, elevator and wing flaps are operated through control rods, while the rudder 
is controlled by cables. The flaps are electrically operated. Elevator forces can be balanced 
by a trim tab on the elevator, which is operated by a Bowden cable. Rudder forces can 
be balanced by a trim tab on the rudder, which is also operated by a Bowden cable. 
Ailerons 
Construction:     GFRP/CFRP composite sandwich. 
Hinges:           There are 4 hinges, which are hinge pins mounted in an aluminum 
                  bracket. They are secured in position by a roll pin. The absence of this 
                  roll pin can lead to the loss of the hinge pin and a consequent loss of flight 
                  safety. 
Operation:        A rod end bearing is screwed into a steel push rod and locked by means 
                  of a jam nut which has locking varnish applied to it. Damage to this 
                  varnish can indicate a twisting and thus a change to the adjustment. The 
                  connection between the rod end bearing and the control horn is a bolt, 
                  the nut of which is likewise sealed with locking varnish. 
                  The aluminum control horn is attached to the aileron with 3 screws.

 DA 42 AFM                                                          Airplane Description 
Flaps 
The flaps are a two piece construction. The inner part of the flap is mounted to the center 
wing and the outer part to the wing. Both parts are connected to each other with a form 
fit connection.  
Construction:     GFRP/CFRP composite sandwich. 
Hinges:           There are 6 hinges at the outer part and 4 hinges at the inner part of the 
                 flap. These hinges are hinge pins mounted in an aluminum bracket. They 
                 are secured in position by a roll pin. The absence of this roll pin can lead 
                 to the loss of the hinge pin and a consequent loss of flight safety.  
Operation:        Each part is connected with a flap control horn to the push rods of the 
                 flap control system. A rod end bearing is screwed into a steel push rod 
                 and locked by means of a jam nut which has locking varnish applied to 
                  it. Damage to this varnish can indicate a twisting and thus a change to 
                 the adjustment. The connection between the rod end bearing and the 
                 control horn is a bolt, the nut of which is likewise sealed with locking 
                 varnish. 
                  Each flap control horn is attached to the flap part with 3 screws.  
The flaps are driven by an electric motor and have 3 settings: 
-  Cruise (UP), totally retracted 
-  Approach (APP), and 
-  Landing (LDG). 
  Doc. No. 7.01.05-E    Rev. 8       15-Dec-2017                         Page 7 - 5

The flaps are operated by means of a 3-position flap selector switch on the instrument 
panel. The positions of the switch correspond to the positions of the flaps, the Cruise 
position of the switch being at the top. If the switch is moved to another position, the flaps 
continue to travel automatically until they have reached the position selected on the switch. 
The UP and LDG positions are additionally protected by a limit switch to guard against 
over-running the end positions. 
The electrical flap drive has an automatic circuit breaker which can also be operated 
manually. 
Flap Position Indicator: 
The current flap position is indicated by means of three lights beside the flap selector 
switch. 
When the upper light (green) is illuminated, the flaps are in the Cruise position (UP); 
when the center light (white) is illuminated, the flaps are in Approach position (APP); 
when the lower light (white) is illuminated, the flaps are in Landing position (LDG). 
When two lights are illuminated simultaneously, the flaps are between the two indicated 
positions. This is the case only when the flaps are in transition.

Elevator 
Construction:     GFRP sandwich. 
Hinges:           5 hinges. 
Operation:        Steel pushrods; 
                  Two of the bellcrank bearings are accessible for visual inspection next 
                  to the lower hinge of the rudder. The elevator horn and its bearing, as 
                  well as the connection to the pushrod, can be visually inspected at the 
                  upper end of the rudder. 
Variable Elevator Stop: 
The DA 42 is equipped with an electrically operated actuator that limits the elevator-up 
travel to 13° as soon as the power setting of both engines exceeds approximately 20 % 
(approach power setting) and the flap selector switch is set to LDG. This is 2.5° less than 
the 15.5° full deflection. 
The linear actuator acts as a movable stop and is controlled by three switches, one for 
each power lever and one for the flap selector. When the power of one engine is reduced 
below approximately 20 %, or the flap selector is not in the LDG position, full elevator 
deflection is regained. 
An amber annunciation (CAUTION) on the G1000 display is provided to inform the pilot 
in case a malfunction occurs. The annunciation illuminates when the variable stop should 
be in place and is actually not activated (power on condition) or should be retracted and 
actually limits the elevator travel (power off condition).

Rudder 
Construction:    GFRP sandwich. 
Hinges:          Upper hinge: One bolt. 
                 Lower hinge: Bearing bracket including rudder stops, held by 4 screws 
                 to the rear web of the vertical stabilizer. The mating part on the rudder 
                 is a bracket which is attached to the rudder by 2 bolts. The bolts and nuts 
                 are accessible to visual inspection. 
Operation:       Steel cables, the eyes of which are connected to the bolts on the bracket.

Elevator Trim 
The trim control is a black wheel in the center console to the rear of the power lever. To 
guard against overrotating, the trim wheel incorporates a friction device. A mark on the 
wheel shows the take-off (T/O) position. 
                         Turn wheel to the front     =  nose down 
                         Turn wheel to the rear      =  nose up 
Rudder Trim 
The trim control is a black wheel in the center console below the instrument panel. A mark 
on the wheel shows the center position and the direction of movement. 
                         Turn wheel to the right     =  right turn 
                         Turn wheel to the left      =  left turn 
Pedal Adjustment 
                                           NOTE 
                    The pedals may only be adjusted on the ground! 
The pedals are unlocked by pulling the black T-grip handle which is located behind the 
rear attachment, straight back. 
                                           NOTE 
               When adjusting rudder pedals to install the control surfaces 
               gust lock pull straight back on T-grip, do not pull up. 
Forward Adjustment: 
Whilst keeping the handle pulled, push the pedals forward with your feet. Release the 
handle and allow the pedals to lock into place.

Using the unlocking handle, pull the pedals back to the desired position. Release the 
handle and push the pedals forward with your feet until they lock into place. 
Electrical Pedal Adjustment (Optional Equipment, OÄM 42-070) 
                                         NOTE 
                   The pedals may only be adjusted on the ground! 
The pedals are adjusted using a rocker switch, located on the rear wall of the leg room. 
The related circuit breaker is located below the switch. 
Forward Adjustment: 
To move the pedals forward, depress lower side of switch. When pedals are in correct 
position, release switch. 
Rearward Adjustment: 
To move the pedals in the rearward direction, depress upper side of switch. When pedals 
are in correct position, release switch. 
Locking: 
Upon release the switch moves automatically to the 'power off' position, so locking the 
pedals in the present position.

Cockpit Ventilation 
Ventilation in the front is provided by spherical ventilation nozzles (16) in the instrument 
panel. Furthermore there are spherical nozzles in the roll bar on the left and right side 
next to the front seats as well as on the central console above the passengers  heads. 
The spherical nozzles are opened and closed by twisting. 
Unconditioned ambient air is supplied to the interior through an inlet on the lower side 
of the RH center wing stub. To increase cabin temperatures when operating at low outside 
air temperatures, a winter kit - ventilation may be installed at the inlet. 
The winter kit - ventilation consists of a metal plate with rubber edging and is attached 
to the lower side of the RH center wing stub by a camloc.
