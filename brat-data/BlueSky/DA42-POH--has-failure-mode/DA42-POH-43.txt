may be loaded there provided it is restrained by means of a baggage net. 
7.8    CANOPY, REAR DOOR, AND CABIN INTERIOR 
Front Canopy 
The front canopy is closed by pulling down on the canopy frame, following which it is locked 
by means of a handle on the left hand side of the frame. On locking, steel bolts lock into 
mating holes in polyethylene blocks. 
“Cooling gap” position: A second setting allows the bolts to lock in, leaving a gap under 
the forward canopy. 
The canopy can be blocked by a locking device on the left side near the canopy opening 
lever by turning the key clockwise. The closed and blocked canopy can be opened from 
inside by pulling the lever inside the opening handle. 
                                        WARNING 
               The airplane may be operated with the front canopy in the 
               “cooling gap” position on the ground only. Before take-off the 
               front canopy must be completely closed and locked.  
               Do not block the front canopy with the locking key before flight 
               in order to assure emergency evacuation from outside. 
A window on the left and right hand side of the canopy can be opened for additional 
ventilation or as an emergency window.

Rear Door 
The rear door is closed in the same way, by pulling down on the frame and locking it with 
the handle. A gas pressure damper prevents the door from dropping; in strong winds the 
assembly must be securely held. The rear door is protected against unintentional opening 
by an additional lever. 
The door can be blocked by a locking device on the left side near the door opening lever 
by turning the key clockwise. The closed and blocked door can be opened from inside 
by pulling the lever inside the opening handle. 
                                       WARNING 
               Do not block the door with the locking key before flight in 
               order to assure emergency access from outside. 
Heating and Ventilation 
Heating and ventilation are operated using two levers located on the small center console 
under the instrument panel. 
Right lever:                       up        =  HEATING ON (Seats, Floor) 
                                   down      =  HEATING OFF 
Center lever :                     up        =   DEFROST ON (Airflow to canopy) 
                                   down      =   DEFROST OFF 
The heat of the RH engine is used for the front seats and floor, the heat of the LH engine 
is used to defrost the canopy.  
The air inlet for the ventilation system is placed on the underside of the RH wing, inboard 
of the engine nacelle. The air is distributed within the cabin via 6 nozzles (2 on the 
instrument panel LH/RH side, 2 on the overhead panel and 2 on the LH/RH side of the 
passenger compartment). The jet direction of each cone can be changed easily and the 
jet intensity can be regulated by rotation of the nozzle.
