1.1    INTRODUCTION
This Airplane Flight Manual has been prepared in order to provide pilots and instructors
with all the information required for the safe and efficient operation of the airplane.
The Airplane Flight Manual includes all the data which must be made available to the pilot
according to the JAR-23 requirement. Beyond this, it contains further data and operating
instructions which, in the manufacturer’s opinion, could be of value to the pilot.
This Airplane Flight Manual is valid for all serial numbers with a KAP 140 or no autopilot
system installed. Equipment and modification level (design details) of the airplane may
vary from serial number to serial number. Therefore, some of the information contained
in this manual is applicable depending on the respective equipment and modification level.
The exact equipment of your serial number is recorded in the Equipment Inventory in
Section 6.5. The modification level is recorded in the following table (as far as necessary
for this manual).

DA 42 AFM                                                                            General
                                        CAUTION
              The DA 42 is a twin engine airplane. When the operating
              limitations and maintenance requirements are complied with,
              it has the high degree of reliability which is required by the
              certification  basis.  Nevertheless,  an  engine  failure  is  not
              completely    impossible.    For   this   reason    it  is  highly
              recommended for flights during the night, on top, under IMC,
              or above terrain which is unsuitable for a landing, to select
              flight times and flight routes such that reduced performance
              in case of single engine operation does not constitute a risk.
