Density Altitude:
                  Altitude in ISA conditions at which the air density is equal to the current
                  air density.

(d)  Mass and Balance
CG:              Center of Gravity, also called 'center of mass'. Imaginary point in which
                 the airplane mass is assumed to be concentrated for mass and balance
                 calculations. Its distance from the Datum Plane is equal to the Center
                 of Gravity Moment Arm.
Center of Gravity Moment Arm:
                 The Moment Arm which is obtained if one divides the sum of the individual
                 moments of the airplane by its total mass.
Center of Gravity Limits:
                 The Center of Gravity range within which the airplane, at a given mass,
                 must be operated.
DP:              Datum  Plane;  an  imaginary  vertical  plane  from  which  all  horizontal
                 distances for center of gravity calculations are measured.
Empty Mass:      The mass of the airplane including unusable fuel, all operating fluids and
                 the maximum quantity of oil.
Maximum Take-off Mass:
                 The maximum permissible mass for take-off.
Maximum Landing Mass:
                 The highest mass for landing conditions at the maximum descent velocity.
                 This velocity was used in the strength calculations to determine the
                 landing gear loads during a particularly hard landing.
Moment Arm:      The horizontal distance from the Datum Plane to the Center of Gravity
                 of a component.
Moment:          The mass of a component multiplied by its moment arm.
