3.2    AIRPLANE-RELATED G1000 WARNINGS
3.2.1  WARNINGS / GENERAL
"Warning" means that the non-observation of the corresponding procedure leads to an
immediate or important degradation in flight safety. The warning text is displayed in red
color. A warning chime tone of 1.5 seconds duration will sound and repeat without delay
until the alarm is acknowledged by the crew.
3.2.2  L/R ENG TEMP
 L/R ENG TEMP                   Left / Right engine coolant temperature is in the upper
                                red range (too high / above 105 °C).
Coolant temperatures above the limit value of 105 °C can lead to a total loss of power
due to engine failure.
 -   Check G1000 for L/R COOL LVL caution message (low coolant level).
L/R COOL LVL caution message not displayed:
During Climb:
 -   Reduce power on affected engine by 10 % or more as required.
 -   Increase airspeed by 10 KIAS or more as required.
 -   If the coolant temperature does not reach the green range within 60 seconds,
     reduce power on affected engine as far as possible and increase airspeed.

During Cruise:
 -   Reduce power on affected engine.
 -   Increase airspeed.
 -   Check coolant temperature in green range.
                                        CAUTION
               If high coolant temperature is indicated and the L/R COOL
               LVL caution message is not displayed, it can be assumed that
               there is no technical defect in the cooling system and that the
               above mentioned procedure can decrease the temperature(s).
               This might not be the case if the coolant temperature does
               not  return  to  the  green  range.  In  this  case  perform  a
               precautionary landing on the nearest suitable airfield. Prepare
               for an engine failure in accordance with 3.5.6 - ENGINE
               FAILURES IN FLIGHT. 
END OF CHECKLIST
L/R COOL LVL caution message displayed:
 -   Reduce power on affected engine.
 -   Expect loss of coolant.
                                       WARNING
               A further increase in coolant temperature must be expected.
               Prepare    for  an   engine   failure  in  accordance     with

                                range (too high / above 140 °C).
Oil temperatures above the limit value of 140 °C can lead to a total loss of power due
to engine failure.
 -   Check oil pressure.
If the oil pressure is outside of the green range (lower limit):
 -   Reduce power on affected engine.
 -   Expect loss of engine oil.
                                       WARNING
               A  further  increase  in  oil  temperature  must  be  expected.
               Prepare    for  an   engine   failure  in  accordance     with
               3.5.6 - ENGINE FAILURES IN FLIGHT.
If the oil pressure is within the green range:
       -       Reduce power on affected engine.

                                        CAUTION
               If high oil temperature is announced and the oil pressure
               indication is within the green range, it can be assumed that
               there is no technical defect in the engine oil system and that
               the  above    mentioned     procedure    can   decrease     the
               temperature(s).  This  might  not  be  the  case  if  the  oil
               temperature does not return to the green range. In this case
               perform  a  precautionary  landing  on  the  nearest  suitable

 L/R OIL PRES                    Left / Right engine oil pressure is in the lower red
                                 range (too low / below 1 bar).
Oil pressures below the limit value of 1 bar can lead to a total loss of power due to engine
failure.
 -   Reduce power on affected engine.
 -   Expect loss of oil. 
                                       WARNING

3.2.5  L/R GBOX TEMP
                                 Left / Right engine gearbox temperature is in the upper
 L/R GBOX TEMP
                                 red range (too high / above 120 °C).
Gearbox temperatures above the limit value of 120 °C can lead to a total loss of power
due to engine failure.
 -   Reduce power on affected engine.
 -   Increase airspeed.
                                        CAUTION
               At  high  ambient  temperature  conditions  and/or  at  low
               airspeeds with high power settings, it can be assumed that
               there is no technical defect in the gearbox and that the above
               mentioned procedure will decrease the temperature(s). This
               might not be the case if the gearbox temperature does not
               return   to   the   green   range.   In   this   case   perform   a
               precautionary landing on the nearest suitable airfield. Prepare

 L/R FUEL TEMP
                                 (too high / above 75 °C).
Fuel temperatures above the limit value of 75 °C can lead to a noticeable reduction of
the high pressure pump efficiency.
 -   Reduce power on affected engine.
 -   Increase airspeed.
                                        CAUTION
               At  high  ambient  temperature  conditions  and/or  at  low
               airspeeds with high power settings and low fuel quantities,
               it can be assumed that the above mentioned procedure will
               decrease the temperature(s). If the fuel temperature does not
               return to the green range, perform a precautionary landing
               on the nearest suitable airfield.
                                           NOTE
               Increased fuel temperature can occur when the fuel quantity
               in the main tank is low. If the auxiliary tank is installed the fuel
               temperature can be decreased by transferring fuel from the
               auxiliary to the main tank.
