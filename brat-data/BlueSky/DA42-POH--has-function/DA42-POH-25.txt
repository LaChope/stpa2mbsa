3.5    ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE PROCEDURES
                                        WARNING
               In certain combinations of airplane  weight, configuration,
               ambient  conditions,  speed  and  pilot  skill,  negative  climb
               performance      may    result.   Refer    to   Chapter    5   -
               PERFORMANCE for one engine inoperative performance
               data.
               In  any  event  the  sudden  application  of  power  during
               one-engine inoperative operation makes the control of the
               airplane more difficult.
3.5.1  DETECTING THE INOPERATIVE ENGINE
                                           NOTE
               One engine inoperative means an asymmetric loss of thrust,
               resulting in uncommanded yaw and roll in direction of the
               so-called "dead" engine (with coordinated controls). To handle
               this situation it is vital to maintain directional control by mainly
               rudder and additional aileron input. The following mnemonic
               can help to identify the failed engine:
                                "Dead foot - dead engine" 
               This means that, once directional control is re-established,
               the pilot can feel the control force on the foot pushing the
               rudder-pedal on the side of the operative engine, while the
               foot on the side of the failed engine feels no force. Further,
               the engine instruments can help to analyze the situation.

3.5.4  UNFEATHERING & RESTARTING THE ENGINE IN FLIGHT
                                      WARNING
              Do not attempt to restart the feathered engine when the
              reason of the engine failure cannot be identified since the
              un-feathered propeller of an inoperative engine might not be
              able to be feathered again.
                                      WARNING
              An  unfeathered  propeller   causes  increased   drag  and
              reduces/increases climb/sink rate up to 200 ft/min.
If the reason of the engine failure can be identified as the result of an improper handling
by the pilot and there is no indication of malfunction or engine fire a restart may be
attempted. Refer to 3.5.2 - ENGINE TROUBLE SHOOTING to check for possible causes.
If TAE 125-01 engines are installed:
                                         NOTE
              Restarting the engine in flight is possible at altitudes below
              6000 ft pressure altitude.
              Above  6000  ft  pressure  altitude  restart  has  not  been
              demonstrated.

Feathering the engine, if engine does not start:
                                        WARNING
               One attempt to feather the engine results in a loss of altitude
               of up to 500 ft. Do not attempt to feather the engine if the
               altitude is insufficient to execute the procedure.
                                         CAUTION
               If the propeller does not feather after the first attempt, do not
               carry out further attempts to feather the propeller to avoid
               further loss of altitude.
                                            NOTE
               In order to feather the propeller the propeller RPM must be
               above 1800 RPM. Below 1800 RPM the centrifugal latches
               of the start locks will not disengage and the propeller will keep

                                           CAUTION
                If the propeller does not feather after the first attempt, do not
                carry out further attempts to feather the propeller to avoid
                further loss of altitude.
                                             NOTE
                In order to feather the propeller the propeller RPM must be
                above 1800 RPM. Below 1800 RPM the centrifugal latches
                of the start locks will not disengage and the propeller will keep
                wind-milling.
                Increase the airspeed swiftly to minimize altitude loss. In case
                of shaking rotation, continue to accelerate the airplane until
                1800 RPM is reached.

              used for the remaining engine, to extend range and maintain
              lateral balance by setting the fuel selector of the remaining
              engine to the CROSSFEED position. If one of the power
              levers is set to low settings the landing gear warning horn is

    -   Decide whether to abort or to continue the take-off.
Continued take-off:
                                            WARNING
                A continued take-off is not recommended if the steady rate
                of   climb  according  to  Section   5.3.9  -   ONE  ENGINE
                 INOPERATIVE CLIMB performance is less than 3.3 %. Under
                certain   combinations   of   ambient   conditions,   such   as
                turbulence, crosswinds and wind shear as well as pilot skill
                the  resulting  climb  performance  may  nevertheless  be
                insufficient to continue the take-off successfully. Therefore
                a continued take-off with a failed engine has to be avoided
                if at all possible.

3.5.6  ENGINE FAILURES IN FLIGHT
(a)  Engine Failure During Initial Climb at Airspeeds Below vmCA = 68 KIAS
                                         WARNING
               As the climb is a flight condition which is associated with high
                power settings, airspeeds lower than vmCA = 68 KIAS should
                be avoided as a sudden engine failure can lead to loss of
                control.  In  this  case  it  is  very  important  to  reduce  the
                asymmetry in thrust to regain directional control.
 1.   Rudder    ___________________________________________  apply for directional control
 2.   Power levers  _____________________________________ retard as required to maintain
                                                           directional control

3.5.8  GO-AROUND / BALKED LANDING WITH ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE
                                          CAUTION
                The go-around / balked landing is not recommended to be
                initiated below a minimum of 800 ft above ground.
                For performance data with one engine inoperative and flaps
                and gear UP refer to 5.3.9 - ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE
                CLIMB PERFORMANCE.
                Under certain combinations of ambient conditions, such as
                turbulence, cross wind and windshear, as well as pilot skill,
                the  resulting  climb  performance  may  nevertheless  be
                insufficient for a successful go-around / balked landing.
 1.   POWER lever      ____________________________________ MAX / as required
 2.   Rudder    ___________________________________________ maintain directional control
 3.   Airspeed    __________________________________________ v  = 82 KIAS / as required
                                                            YSE
 4.  Landing gear  _____________________________________  UP / retract
 5.   FLAPS _____________________________________________ UP

If a positive rate of climb cannot be established:
-   Land so as to keep clear of obstacles. 
If time allows the following steps can reduce the risk of fire in an event of collision with
obstacles after touchdown:
 6.  ENGINE MASTER          ______________________________both OFF
 7.  FUEL SELECTOR   ______________________________both OFF
 8.  FLAPS      ___________________________________________ APP or LDG, as required
                                            NOTE
                If landing is performed off airfield, depending on the surface
               condition it may be beneficial to land with the gear UP. Note
               that the energy absorbing function of the landing gear is lost
                in such cases.
                                            NOTE
                Extending  the  gear  and  extending  the  flaps  to  LDG  will
                increase drag and incur a high sink rate. Only when the
                landing area can be reached safely, landing with flaps LDG
                is advisable.

 10. LANDING GEAR _________________________________UP
 11. Touch down _____________________________________ lowest practical speed
Immediately after touchdown:
 12. ELECT. MASTER _______________________________ OFF
                                             NOTE
                If the ELECT. MASTER is switched OFF before touchdown
                the landing gear will extend slowly.

3.5.9  FLIGHT WITH ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE
                                         CAUTION
               Even if a positive flight performance can be established with
               one engine inoperative, land as soon as practicable at the
               next suitable airfield / airport.
 1.   Airspeed  __________________________________________above vmCA = 68 KIAS to
                                                          maintain directional control
 2.  Remaining engine _______________________________ monitor engine instruments
                                                         continuously
 3.  Fuel quantity  _____________________________________ monitor continuously
 4.  FUEL SELECTOR          ______________________________remaining engine / set
                                                          CROSSFEED or ON so as to
                                                          keep fuel quantity laterally
                                                          balanced
                                            NOTE
               If the FUEL SELECTOR is set on CROSSFEED, the engine
               will be supplied with fuel from the main tank on the opposite
               side.
               This will extend range and helps to keep the wings laterally
               balanced (see 2.14 - FUEL).
Land as soon as possible according to Section 3.5.7 - LANDING WITH ONE ENGINE
INOPERATIVE.
If the situation allows, you may climb to a safe altitude for troubleshooting (3.5.2 - ENGINE
TROUBLESHOOTING) in order to try to restore engine power.
