7.6    SEATS AND SAFETY HARNESSES 
To increase passive safety, the seats are constructed using a carbon fiber/Kevlar hybrid 
material and GFRP. The seats are removable to allow maintenance and inspection of 
the underlying controls. Covers on the control sticks prevent loose objects from falling 
into the area of the controls. 
The seats have removable furnishings and are equipped with energy-absorbing foam 
elements. 
The seats are fitted with three-part safety harnesses. The harnesses are fastened by 
inserting the end of the belts in the belt lock, and are opened by pressing the red release 
on the belt lock. 
The backs of the rear seats can be laid forward after pulling upwards on the locking bolt 
knob. 
If front seats with adjustable backrests are installed (OÄM 42-067 or OÄM 42-259), the 
angle of the backrest and the lumbar can be adjusted for best comfort. The backrest control 
lever is situated on the outboard side of the backrest if OÄM 42-067 is installed. The 
backrest release button, in case of OÄM 42-259 is situated on the upper side of the seat’s 
side frame. However, during take-off, landing and emergency landing the backrests must 
be fixed in the upright position designated by a placard on the roll-over bar.  
The lumbar support can be adjusted by operating the lumbar support lever mounted on 
the outboard side of the seat pan. 
                                        CAUTION 
               Before  adjusting  the  angle,  lean  against  the  backrest  to 
               counteract the spring load; otherwise the backrest may slap 
               forward.

                                        CAUTION 
               Do not apply a load of more than 90 daN (202 lbf) to the top 
               of  the  backrest.  Otherwise  damage  of  the  adjustment 
               mechanism may result.  
For adjustment lift the backrest lever or press the button and bend the backrest forward 
or backward to the desired backrest angle. For fixing the position press down the backrest 
lever or release the button. 
If OÄM 42-259 is installed and in case of a malfunction of the release button the backrest 
can be moved into the upright position by pulling the backrest (48 daN [108 lbf]) in flight 
(FWD) direction. 
If OÄM 42-067 is installed and in case of a defective adjustment mechanism the outboard 
friction adjustment screw can be tightened with a 10 mm hexagon nut in clockwise direction 
in order to fix the backrest in the upright position. 
If possible, set the backrest lever to the ”locked” position. The mechanism must be repaired 
at the next scheduled inspection.
