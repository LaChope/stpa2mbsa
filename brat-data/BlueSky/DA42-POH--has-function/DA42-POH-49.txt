8.5    GROUND HANDLING / ROAD TRANSPORT
8.5.1  GROUND HANDLING
To move the airplane on ground, it can be pushed or pulled by hand on the inner section
of the propeller blades near the spinner or pushed at the wing nose and at the rough
surface of the center wing, inboard of the nacelles. Do not push on the spinners, as you
may damage the spinner which can cause vibration and damage to the engine. Do not
use force on the propeller tips or on the airplane control surfaces and do not push on the
de-icing nozzles (if installed) on the propeller blade root, as you may damage the propeller,
the control surfaces or the de-icing nozzles.
It is recommended to use the steering bar or a tow bar which is available from the
manufacturer to assist steering and towing. The tow bar is engaged in the appropriate
hole in the nosewheel as shown in the figure below.

                                        CAUTION
               If the airplane is towed by steering / tow bar by hand or a tow
               vehicle, do not turn the nose wheel more than 40 degrees
               to either side from the center position. Otherwise damage to
               the torque links of the nose landing gear will result.
When towing the airplane with a tow vehicle, a qualified person must sit in the cockpit
ready for immediate braking action, in the event that the tow vehicle becomes uncoupled.
The movement of the tow vehicle should always be started and stopped slowly to avoid
shock loads on the nose landing gear. The maximum steering angle of 40 degrees to either
side must not be exceeded.
                                        WARNING
                The tow bar must be removed before starting the engine.
If the airplane must be pulled out of soft ground or deep snow, towing lines must be used.
The towing lines should be attached to the main landing gear struts as high as possible
without interfering with the brake lines. The ropes should be long enough to sufficiently
clear the nose or tail. A qualified person must sit in the cockpit to maintain control of the
airplane using the nose wheel steering and brakes.
                                        WARNING
             All towing lines must be removed before starting the engines.

8.5.2  PARKING
For short term parking, the airplane must be positioned into the wind, the parking brake
must be engaged and the wing flaps must be in the retracted position. For extended and
unattended parking, as well as in unpredictable wind conditions, the airplane must be
anchored to the ground or placed in a hangar. Parking in a hangar is recommended.
Refer to the Airplane Maintenance Manual, Doc. No. 7.02.01, latest revision for necessary
parking procedures. Use the short term parking procedure when the airplane will be parked
for less than 5 days. Use the long term parking procedure when the airplane will be parked
for 5 to 30 days. Use the storage procedure when the airplane will be parked for more
than 30 days. 
                                          NOTE
               If the airplane is not used for more than 4 weeks an engine
               ground run must be performed. Refer to the Engine Operation
               and Maintenance Manual, latest revision.
Control Surfaces Gust Lock
The manufacturer offers a control surfaces gust lock which can be used to block the
primary controls. It is recommended that the control surfaces gust lock be used when
parking outdoors, because otherwise the control surfaces can hit the stops in strong tail
wind. This can lead to excessive wear or damage.
                                       WARNING
              The control surfaces gust lock must be removed before flight.

The control surfaces gust lock is installed as follows: 
      1. Move the rudder pedals fully forward.
      2. Engage the control surfaces gustlock with the pedals.
      3. Engage the stick, wrap straps around stick once.
      4. Attach the locks and tighten the straps.
For removal reverse the sequence.

8.5.3  MOORING
Near the lower end of the tail fin of the airplane there is a hole which can be used to tie
down the airplane to the ground. Also on each wing near the wing tip, an eyelet with a
metric M8 thread can be installed and used as tie-down points.
8.5.4  JACKING
The airplane can be jacked at the two jackpoints located on the lower side of the center
wing's LH and RH root ribs as well as at the tail fin.
