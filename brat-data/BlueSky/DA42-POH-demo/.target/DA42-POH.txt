CAUTIONThe DA 42 is a twin engine airplane. When the operatinglimitations and maintenance requirements are complied with,it has the high degree of reliability which is required by thecertification basis. Nevertheless, an engine failure is notcompletely impossible. For this reason it is highlyrecommended for flights during the night, on top, under IMC,or above terrain which is unsuitable for a landing, to selectflight times and flight routes such that reduced performancein case of single engine operation does not constitute a risk.

1.8 G1000 AVIONICS SYSTEM
1. The G1000 Integrated Avionics System is a fully integrated flight, engine,communication, navigation and surveillance instrumentation system. The systemconsists of a Primary Flight Display (PFD), Multi-Function Display (MFD), audio panel,Air Data Computer (ADC), Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS), enginesensors and processing unit (GEA), and integrated avionics (GIA) containing VHFcommunications, VHF navigation, and GPS (Global Positioning System).
2. The primary function of the PFD is to provide attitude, heading, air data, navigation,and alerting information to the pilot. The PFD may also be used for flight planning.The primary function of the MFD is to provide engine information, mapping, terraininformation, and for flight planning. The audio panel is used for selection of radios fortransmitting and listening, intercom functions, and marker beacon functions.
3. The primary function of the VHF Communication portion of the G1000 is to enableexternal radio communication. The primary function of the VOR/ILS Receiver portionof the equipment is to receive and demodulate VOR, Localizer, and Glide Slope signals.The primary function of the GPS portion of the system is to acquire signals from theGPS satellites, recover orbital data, make range and Doppler measurements, andprocess this information in real-time to obtain the userâ€™s position, velocity, and time.
4. Provided a Garmin G1000 GPS receiver is receiving adequate usable signals, it hasbeen demonstrated capable of and has been shown to meet the accuracy specificationsfor:
(a) VFR/IFR enroute, oceanic, terminal, and non-precision instrument approach (GPS,Loran-C, VOR, VOR-DME, TACAN, NDB, NDB-DME, RNAV) operation within theU.S. National Airspace System in accordance with AC 20-138A.
General DA 42 AFM
Page 1 - 22 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
(b) The systems meets RNP5 airspace (BRNAV) requirements of AC 90-96 and inaccordance with AC 20-138A, and FAA Order 8110.60 for oceanic and remoteairspace operations, provided it is receiving useable navigation information fromthe GPS receiver. The system meets the accuracy requirements of EASA AMC 20-4for Basic RNAV.
(c) The Garmin GNSS navigation system as installed in this airplane complies withthe equipment requirements of FAA AC 90-100A for RNAV 2 and RNAV 1operations.
(d) The Garmin GNSS navigation system as installed in this airplane complies withthe equipment requirements of FAA AC 90-105 and meets the equipmentperformance and functional requirements to conduct RNP terminal departure andarrival procedures and RNP approach procedures without RF (radius to fix) legs.(RNP1, RNP APCH0.3 LNAV). 
(e) The Garmin GNSS navigation system as installed in this airplane has been foundto comply with the requirements for primary means of Class II navigation in oceanicand remote navigation (RNP-10) without time limitations in accordance with FAAAC 20-138A and FAA Order 8400.12A. The Garmin GNSS navigation system canbe used without reliance on other long-range navigation system. 
Navigation is accomplished using the WGS-84 (NAD-83) coordinate reference datum.GPS navigation data is based upon use of only the GPS operated by the United Statesof America.

5. If the Garmin GWX 68 Weather Radar System is installed, it can be used to aid thepilot in avoiding thunderstorms and associated turbulence or for ground mapping. TheGWX 68 shall be used to avoid severe weather and not for penetrating severe weather.Pulse type weather radar systems like the GWX 68 detect precipitation only, not cloudsor turbulence. The display may indicate clear areas between intense returns, but thisdoes not necessarily mean it is safe to fly between them. As installed on the DA 42,the Garmin GWX 68 has a demonstrated range of 160 nautical miles. Refer to GarminG1000 Pilotâ€™s Guide for the DA 42, P/N 190-00649-04 in the latest effective issue forfurther information.

3.1 INTRODUCTION
3.1.1  GENERAL
This chapter contains checklists as well as the description of recommended proceduresto be followed in the event of an emergency. Engine failure or other airplane-relatedemergencies are most unlikely to occur if the prescribed procedures for pre-flight checksand airplane maintenance are followed.
If, nonetheless, an emergency does arise, the guidelines given in this chapter should befollowed and applied in order to clear the problem.
As it is impossible to foresee all kinds of emergencies and cover them in this AirplaneFlight Manual, a thorough understanding of the airplane by the pilot is, in addition to hisknowledge and experience, an essential factor in the solution of any problems which mayarise.
WARNINGIn each emergency, control over the flight attitude and thepreparation of a possible emergency landing have priorityover attempts to solve the current problem ("first fly theaircraft"). Prior to the flight the pilot must consider thesuitability of the terrain for an emergency landing for eachphase of the flight. For a safe flight the pilot must constantlykeep a safe minimum flight altitude. Solutions for variousadverse scenarios should be thought over in advance. Thisshould prevent a situation where the pilot is faced with anemergency he cannot handle calmly and with determination.

3.5.1  DETECTING THE INOPERATIVE ENGINE
NOTEOne engine inoperative means an asymmetric loss of thrust,resulting in uncommanded yaw and roll in direction of theso-called "dead" engine (with coordinated controls). To handlethis situation it is vital to maintain directional control by mainlyrudder and additional aileron input. The following mnemoniccan help to identify the failed engine:
"Dead foot - dead engine" 
This means that, once directional control is re-established,the pilot can feel the control force on the foot pushing therudder-pedal on the side of the operative engine, while thefoot on the side of the failed engine feels no force. Further,the engine instruments can help to analyze the situation.

3.5.2  ENGINE TROUBLESHOOTING
WARNINGControl over the flight attitude has priority over attempts tosolve the current problem ("first fly the aircraft").
NOTEWith respect to handling and performance, the left-handengine (pilots view) is considered the "critical" engine.
Depending on the situation the following attempts can be made to restore engine powerprior to securing the engine:
CAUTIONOnce the engine has been shut down for longer than30 seconds, it can only be restarted below 8000 ft(TAE 125-02-99 engine) or 6000 ft (TAE 125-01 engine)pressure altitude. Proceed in accordance with 3.5.4 -UNFEATHERING & RESTARTING THE ENGINE IN FLIGHT.

3.5.4  UNFEATHERING & RESTARTING THE ENGINE IN FLIGHT
WARNINGDo not attempt to restart the feathered engine when thereason of the engine failure cannot be identified since theun-feathered propeller of an inoperative engine might not beable to be feathered again.
WARNINGAn unfeathered propeller causes increased drag andreduces/increases climb/sink rate up to 200 ft/min.
If the reason of the engine failure can be identified as the result of an improper handlingby the pilot and there is no indication of malfunction or engine fire a restart may beattempted. Refer to 3.5.2 - ENGINE TROUBLE SHOOTING to check for possible causes.
If TAE 125-01 engines are installed:

3.6 LANDING GEAR SYSTEM FAILURES
3.6.1  LANDING GEAR UNSAFE WARNING
NOTEThe landing gear unsafe warning light illuminates if thelanding gear is neither in the final up or down & lockedposition. Illumination of this light is therefore normal duringtransit.
If the light remains on for longer than 20 seconds during landing gear retraction / extension:
1. Airspeed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . check below vLOR 156 KIAS2. Gear selector . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . re-cycle if continued illumination
occurs
If the landing gear cannot be extended to the down & locked position or red light doesnot extinguish:
- Continue with 3.6.2 - MANUAL EXTENSION OF THE LANDING GEAR.

Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 3 - 47
NOTEIf the landing gear cannot be retracted to the final up positionyou may continue the flight with the landing gear extendedin the down & locked position. Consider for higheraerodynamic drag, resulting in degraded flight performance,increased fuel consumption and decreased range.
With the landing gear extended and at aft CG-locations, withflaps up and full power applied, the airplane will easily recoverfrom sideslip if the trim is set to neutral (normal procedure).Otherwise it may require corrective action with a moderateamount of rudder input.
In cold ambient temperatures it may help to reduce theairspeed below 110 KIAS for landing gear operation.

3.6.4  LANDING WITH A DEFECTIVE TIRE ON THE MAIN LANDING GEAR
CAUTIONA defective (e.g. burst) tire is not usually easy to detect. Thedamage normally occurs during take-off or landing, and ishardly noticeable during fast  taxiing. It is only during the roll-out after landing or at lower taxiing speeds that a tendencyto swerve occurs. Rapid and determined action is thenrequired.
1. Advise ATC.
2. Land the airplane at the edge of the runway that is located on the side of the intacttire, so that changes in direction which must be expected during roll-out due to thebraking action of the defective tire can be corrected on the runway.
3. Land with one wing low. The wing on the side of the intact tire should be held low.
4. Direction should be maintained using the rudder. This should be supported by useof the brake. It is possible that the brake must be applied strongly - if necessaryto the point where the wheel locks. The wide track of the landing gear will preventthe airplane from tipping over a wide speed range. There is no pronounced tendencyto tip even when skidding.

NOTEIf MÃ„M 42-088 is carried out and OÃ„M 42-195 is not carriedout, a landing with a mass between 1700 kg (3748 lb) and1785 kg (3935 lb) constitutes an abnormal operatingprocedure. 
NOTEvx is always less than vy. For the DA 42 however, the actualvalue of vx would be below the minimum safe speed. Theminimum airspeed for best angle of climb was therefore raisedto the value of vy.

4A.4 FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS
The DA 42 is to be flown with "the feet on the pedalsâ€œ, meaning that coordinated flightin all phases and configurations shall be supported by dedicated use of the rudder andailerons together.
With the landing gear extended and at aft CG-locations, with flaps up and full powerapplied, the airplane will easily recover from sideslip if the trim is set to neutral (normalprocedure), otherwise it may require corrective action with a moderate amount of rudderinput.
4A.5 DAILY CHECK
Before the first flight of a day it must be ensured that the following checks are performed.
* On-condition check of the canopy, the side door and the baggage compartment doorsfor cracks and major scratches.
* On-condition check of the hinges for the canopy, the side door and the baggagecompartment doors.
* Visual inspection of the locking bolts for proper movement with no backlash.
* Tire inflation pressure check 
(main wheels: 4.7 bar / 68 PSI if OÃ„M 42-195 is installed, 
4.5 bar / 65 PSI if OÃ„M 42-195 is not installed, 
 nose wheel: 6.0 bar / 87 PSI).
* Visual inspection of both spinners and their attachment.
* If OÃ„M 42-077 (removable fuselage nose cone) is implemented: Check fuselage nose cone for improper fit and loose attachment screws.

4B.1 PRECAUTIONARY LANDING
NOTEA landing of this type is only necessary when there is areasonable suspicion that due to operational factors such asfuel shortage, weather conditions, etc. the possibility ofendangering the airplane and its occupants by continuing theflight cannot be excluded. The pilot is required to decidewhether or not a controlled landing in a field represents alower risk than the attempt to reach the nearest airfield underall circumstances.
NOTEIf no level landing area is available, a landing on an upwardslope should be sought.
1. Select appropriate landing area.2. Consider wind.3. Approach:
If possible, the landing area should be overflown at a suitable height in order torecognize obstacles. The degree of offset at each part of the circuit will allow thewind speed and direction to be assessed.

5.1 INTRODUCTION
The performance tables and diagrams on the following pages are presented so that, onthe one hand, you can see what performance you can expect from your airplane, whileon the other they allow comprehensive and sufficiently accurate flight planning. The valuesin the tables and the diagrams were obtained in the framework of the flight trials usingan airplane and power-plant in good condition, and corrected to the conditions of theInternational Standard Atmosphere (ISA = 15 EC / 59 Â°F and 1,013.25 hPa / 29.92 inHgat sea level).
The performance diagrams do not take into account variations in pilot experience or apoorly maintained airplane. The performances given can be attained if the proceduresquoted in this manual are applied, and the airplane has been well maintained.
5.2 USE OF THE PERFORMANCE TABLES AND DIAGRAMS
In order to illustrate the influence of a number of different variables, the performance datais reproduced in the form of tables or diagrams. These contain sufficiently detailedinformation so that conservative values can be selected and used for the determinationof adequate performance data for the planned flight.

WARNINGFor a safe take-off the available runway length must be atleast equal to the take-off distance over a 50 ft (15 m)obstacle.
WARNINGPoor maintenance condition of the airplane, deviation fromthe given procedures, uneven runway, as well as unfavorableexternal factors (high temperature, rain, unfavorable windconditions, including cross-wind) will increase the take-offdistance.
CAUTIONThe figures in the following NOTE are typical values. On wetground or wet soft grass covered runways the take-off rollmay become significantly longer than stated below. In anycase the pilot must allow for the condition of the runway toensure a safe take-off.
NOTEFor take-off from dry, short-cut grass covered runways, thefollowing corrections must be taken into account, comparedto paved runways (typical values, see CAUTION above):
- Grass up to 5 cm (2 in) long: 10 % increase in take-off roll.- Grass 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) long: 15 % increase in take-off
roll.- Grass longer than 10 cm (4 in): at least 25 % increase  in
take-off roll.- On grass longer than 25 cm (10 in), a take-off should not
be attempted.

Page 5 - 12 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
NOTEFor wet grass, an additional 10 % increase in take-off rollmust be expected.
NOTEAn uphill slope of 2 % (2 m per 100 m or 2 ft per 100 ft)results in an increase in the take-off distance of approximately10 %. The effect on the take-off roll can be greater.

WARNINGPoor maintenance condition of the airplane, deviation fromthe given procedures, uneven runway, as well as unfavorableexternal factors (high temperature, rain, unfavorable windconditions, including cross-wind) will increase the landingdistance.
CAUTIONThe figures in the following NOTE are typical values. On wetground or wet soft grass covered runways the landingdistance may become significantly longer than stated below.In any case the pilot must allow for the condition of the runwayto ensure a safe landing.
NOTEFor landings on dry, short-cut grass covered runways, thefollowing corrections must be taken into account, comparedto paved runways (typical values, see CAUTION above):
- Grass up to 5 cm (2 in) long: 5 % increase in landing roll.- Grass 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) long: 15 % increase in landing
roll.- Grass longer than 10 cm (4 in): at least 25 % increase in
landing roll.
NOTEFor wet grass, an additional 10 % increase in landing roll mustbe expected.
NOTEA downhill slope of 2 % (2 m per 100 m or 2 ft per 100 ft)results in an increase in the landing distance of approximately10 %. The effect on the landing roll can be greater.

6.1 INTRODUCTION
In order to achieve the performance and flight characteristics described in this AirplaneFlight Manual and for safe flight operation, the airplane must be operated within thepermissible mass and balance envelope.
The pilot is responsible for adhering to the permissible values for loading and center ofgravity (CG). In this, he should note the movement of the CG due to fuel consumption.The permissible CG range during flight is given in Chapter 2.
The procedure for determining the flight mass CG position is described in this chapter.Additionally a comprehensive list of the equipment approved for this airplane exists(Equipment List). The set of items marked as 'installed' constitutes the EquipmentInventory.
Before the airplane is delivered, the empty mass and the corresponding CG position aredetermined and entered in Section 6.3 - MASS AND BALANCE REPORT.
NOTEFollowing equipment changes the new empty mass and thecorresponding CG position must be determined by calculationor by weighing.
Following repairs or repainting the new empty mass and thecorresponding CG position must be determined by weighing.
Empty mass, empty mass CG position, and the empty massmoment must be certified in the Mass and Balance Reportby authorized personnel.

NOTEThe mass of the winter kit - ventilation is negligible. The massand balance data of the airplane therefore remain unchanged.
6.2 DATUM PLANE
The Datum Plane (DP) is a plane which is normal to the airplaneâ€™s longitudinal axis andin front of the airplane as seen from the direction of flight. The airplaneâ€™s longitudinal axisis parallel with the floor of the nose baggage compartment. When the floor of the nosebaggage compartment is aligned horizontally, the Datum Plane is vertical. The DatumPlane is located 2.196 meters (86.46 in) forward of the most forward point of the root ribon the stub wing.

6.3 MASS AND BALANCE REPORT
The empty mass and the corresponding CG position established before delivery are thefirst entries in the Mass and Balance Report. Every change in permanently installedequipment, and every repair to the airplane which affects the empty mass or the emptymass CG must be recorded in the Mass and Balance Report.
For the calculation of flight mass and corresponding CG position (or moment), the currentempty mass and the corresponding CG position (or moment) in accordance with the Massand Balance Report must always be used.
Condition of the airplane for establishing the empty mass:
- Equipment as per Equipment Inventory (see Section 6.5)
- Including the following operating fluids:
- Brake fluid
- Hydraulic fluid (for the retractable gear)
- Engine oil (2 x 6.0 liter = 2 x 6.3 qts)
- Coolant (2 x 6.0 liter = 2 x 6.3 qts)
- Gearbox oil (2 x 0.9 liter = 2 x 0.95 qts)
- Unusable fuel in main fuel tanks (2 x 1.0 US gal = 2 x 3.8 liter)
- Unusable fuel in auxiliary fuel tanks (if installed, 2 x 0.5 US gal = 2 x 1.9 liter)

6.4 FLIGHT MASS AND CENTER OF GRAVITY
The following information enables you to operate your DA 42 within the permissible massand balance limits. For the calculation of the flight mass and the corresponding CG positionthe following tables and diagrams are required:
6.4.1 - MOMENT ARMS6.4.2 - LOADING DIAGRAM6.4.3 - CALCULATION OF LOADING CONDITION6.4.4 - PERMISSIBLE CENTER OF GRAVITY RANGE6.4.5 - PERMISSIBLE MOMENT RANGE
The diagrams should be used as follows:
1. Take the empty mass and the empty mass moment of your airplane from the Massand Balance Report, and enter the figures in the appropriate boxes under the columnmarked â€˜Your DA 42' in Table 6.4.3 - CALCULATION OF LOADING CONDITION.
2. Read the fuel quantity indicators to determine the fuel quantity in the main fuel tanks.
3. Determine the fuel quantity in the auxiliary fuel tanks (if installed).
To verify an empty auxiliary fuel tank, set the ELECT. MASTER switch and the FUELTRANSFER switch to ON and check the PFD for the L/R AUX FUEL E cautionmessage. 
To verify a full auxiliary fuel tank open the auxiliary fuel tank filler and check fuel level.
If the auxiliary fuel tank quantity is in between empty and full, the exact quantity cannotbe determined. If possible transfer all fuel to the main fuel tank by setting the ELECT.MASTER switch and the FUEL TRANSFER switch to ON until the L/R AUX FUEL Ecaution message appears on the PFD. During this procedure ground power must beused or at least one engine must be running. The fuel transfer will take a maximumof 10 minutes.
DA 42 AFM Mass and Balance
Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 6 - 7
CAUTIONIf the auxiliary tanks are in use, both tanks must be refueledto the maximum level to provide proper information for thepilot about the fuel quantity in the auxiliary fuel tanks. 
If the auxiliary tanks are not in use, the pilot must ensure thatthey are empty.
4. Multiply the individual masses by the moment arms quoted to obtain the moment forevery item of loading and enter these moments in the appropriate boxes in Table6.4.3 - CALCULATION OF LOADING CONDITION.
5. Add up the masses and moments in the respective columns. The CG position iscalculated by dividing the total moment by the total mass (using row 8 for the conditionwith empty fuel tanks, and row 11 for the pre take-off condition). The resulting CGposition must be inside the limits.
As an illustration the total mass and the CG position are entered on Diagram 6.4.4 -PERMISSIBLE CENTER OF GRAVITY RANGE. This checks graphically that thecurrent configuration of the airplane is within the permissible range.
6. Graphical method:
Diagram 6.4.2 - LOADING DIAGRAM is used to determine the moments. The massesand moments for the individual items of loading are added. Then Diagram 6.4.5 -PERMISSIBLE MOMENT RANGE is used to check whether the total momentassociated with the total mass is in the permissible range.
The result found with the graphical method is however inaccurate. In doubtful casesthe result must be verified using the exact method given above.

6.4.3  CALCULATION OF LOADING CONDITION
NOTEIf the optional de-icing system (OÃ„M 42-053 or OÃ„M 42-054)is installed, the following must be observed:The consumption of fuel causes a forward movement of theCG. The consumption of de-icing fluid causes a rearwardmovement of the CG. Depending on the fuel flow and de-icingfluid flow, the overall movement of the CG can be a forwardor a rearward movement. In order to cover all possible cases,the following table must be completed twice: with (as shownin the example) and without considering the on-board de-icingfluid. All four CG positions (fuel tank full/empty, de-icing fluidtank full/empty) must fall into the permitted area.
1. Complete the form on the next page.
2. Divide the total moments from rows 8 and 11 by the related total mass to obtain theCG positions.
In our example: empty tanks: 3625.1 kgm / 1527.5 kg = 2.373 m314,656 in.lb / 3368 lb = 93.43 in
full tanks: 4312.1 kgm / 1770.5 kg = 2.436 m374,295 in.lb / 3904 lb = 95.87 in
3. Locate the values in the diagram in Section 6.4.4 - PERMISSIBLE CENTER OFGRAVITY RANGE. If the CG positions and related masses fall into the permitted area,the loading condition is allowable.
Our example shows allowable loading conditions (for 1785 kg take-off mass, i.e.,MÃ„M 42-088 carried out).

7.1 INTRODUCTION
Chapter 7 contains a description of the airplane and its systems, together with operatinginstructions.
For details about optional equipment see Chapter 9.
7.2 AIRFRAME
Fuselage
The CFRP fuselage is of semi monocoque molded construction. The center wing isattached to the fuselage with bolts. The two main spars and both nacelles are part of thecenter wing. The two main spars are CFRP items. The engine compartment in each nacelleis separated from the other structure with a firewall. The fire protection on the firewall isof a special fire-resistant matting, which is covered on the engine side by stainless steelcladding.
Wings
The wings have a front and rear spar; each wing has a top shell and a bottom shell; Thewhole wing is â€˜fail-safeâ€™ design. The wings, as well as the ailerons and flaps, are madeof GFRP/CFRP, and are principally of sandwich construction. An aluminum fuel tank isinstalled in each of the wings.
Empennage
The airplane has a â€˜Tâ€™ tail of GFRP/CFRP semi monocoque construction. Both thestabilizers have twin spars. Rudder and elevator are of sandwich construction.
Airplane Description DA 42 AFM
Page 7 - 4 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
7.3 FLIGHT CONTROLS
The ailerons, elevator and wing flaps are operated through control rods, while the rudderis controlled by cables. The flaps are electrically operated. Elevator forces can be balancedby a trim tab on the elevator, which is operated by a Bowden cable. Rudder forces canbe balanced by a trim tab on the rudder, which is also operated by a Bowden cable.
Ailerons
Construction: GFRP/CFRP composite sandwich.
Hinges: There are 4 hinges, which are hinge pins mounted in an aluminumbracket. They are secured in position by a roll pin. The absence of thisroll pin can lead to the loss of the hinge pin and a consequent loss of flightsafety.
Operation: A rod end bearing is screwed into a steel push rod and locked by meansof a jam nut which has locking varnish applied to it. Damage to thisvarnish can indicate a twisting and thus a change to the adjustment. Theconnection between the rod end bearing and the control horn is a bolt,the nut of which is likewise sealed with locking varnish.
The aluminum control horn is attached to the aileron with 3 screws. 
DA 42 AFM Airplane Description
Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 7 - 5
Flaps
The flaps are a two piece construction. The inner part of the flap is mounted to the centerwing and the outer part to the wing. Both parts are connected to each other with a formfit connection. 
Construction: GFRP/CFRP composite sandwich.
Hinges: There are 6 hinges at the outer part and 4 hinges at the inner part of theflap. These hinges are hinge pins mounted in an aluminum bracket. Theyare secured in position by a roll pin. The absence of this roll pin can leadto the loss of the hinge pin and a consequent loss of flight safety. 
Operation: Each part is connected with a flap control horn to the push rods of theflap control system. A rod end bearing is screwed into a steel push rodand locked by means of a jam nut which has locking varnish applied toit. Damage to this varnish can indicate a twisting and thus a change tothe adjustment. The connection between the rod end bearing and thecontrol horn is a bolt, the nut of which is likewise sealed with lockingvarnish.
Each flap control horn is attached to the flap part with 3 screws. 
The flaps are driven by an electric motor and have 3 settings:
-  Cruise (UP), totally retracted
-  Approach (APP), and
-  Landing (LDG).
Airplane Description DA 42 AFM
Page 7 - 6 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
The flaps are operated by means of a 3-position flap selector switch on the instrumentpanel. The positions of the switch correspond to the positions of the flaps, the Cruiseposition of the switch being at the top. If the switch is moved to another position, the flapscontinue to travel automatically until they have reached the position selected on the switch.The UP and LDG positions are additionally protected by a limit switch to guard againstover-running the end positions.
The electrical flap drive has an automatic circuit breaker which can also be operatedmanually.
Flap Position Indicator:
The current flap position is indicated by means of three lights beside the flap selectorswitch.
When the upper light (green) is illuminated, the flaps are in the Cruise position (UP);
when the center light (white) is illuminated, the flaps are in Approach position (APP);
when the lower light (white) is illuminated, the flaps are in Landing position (LDG).
When two lights are illuminated simultaneously, the flaps are between the two indicatedpositions. This is the case only when the flaps are in transition.
DA 42 AFM Airplane Description
Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 7 - 7
Elevator
Construction: GFRP sandwich.
Hinges: 5 hinges.
Operation: Steel pushrods;
Two of the bellcrank bearings are accessible for visual inspection nextto the lower hinge of the rudder. The elevator horn and its bearing, aswell as the connection to the pushrod, can be visually inspected at theupper end of the rudder.
Variable Elevator Stop:
The DA 42 is equipped with an electrically operated actuator that limits the elevator-uptravel to 13Â° as soon as the power setting of both engines exceeds approximately 20 %(approach power setting) and the flap selector switch is set to LDG. This is 2.5Â° less thanthe 15.5Â° full deflection.
The linear actuator acts as a movable stop and is controlled by three switches, one foreach power lever and one for the flap selector. When the power of one engine is reducedbelow approximately 20 %, or the flap selector is not in the LDG position, full elevatordeflection is regained.
An amber annunciation (CAUTION) on the G1000 display is provided to inform the pilotin case a malfunction occurs. The annunciation illuminates when the variable stop shouldbe in place and is actually not activated (power on condition) or should be retracted andactually limits the elevator travel (power off condition).

7.5 LANDING GEAR
The landing gear is a fully retractable, hydraulically operated, tricycle landing gear. Strutsfor the landing gear are air oil assemblies.
The hydraulic pressure for the landing gear operation is provided by an electrically poweredhydraulic pump, which is activated by a pressure switch, when the required pressure istoo low. Electrically actuated hydraulic valves, which are operated with the gear selectorswitch, provide the required hydraulic pressure for the movement of the landing gear.The gear selector switch is located on the instrument panel. The switch must be pulledout before it is moved to UP or DOWN position. Gear extension normally takes6 - 10 seconds.
When the landing gear is retracted, the main wheels retract inboard into the center wingand the nose wheel retracts forward into the nose section. Hydraulic pressure on theactuators keeps the landing gear in the retracted position. A pressurized gas containeracts as an accumulator which keeps the system pressure constant by replacing the volumelost due to the normal actuator leakages. This prevents a permanent starting of thehydraulic pump in flight.
Springs assist the hydraulic system in gear extension and locking the gear in the downposition. After the gears are down and the downlock hooks engage, springs maintain forceon each hook to keep it locked until it is released by hydraulic pressure.
The three green lights directly next to the landing gear operating switch illuminate toindicate that each gear is in the correct position and locked. If the gear is in neither thefull up nor the full down position, a red warning light on the instrument panel illuminates.
Should one power lever be placed in a position below approx. 20 % while the landing gearis retracted, a warning horn sounds to alert the pilot that the gear is retracted. If installeda CHECK GEAR caution is indicated on the PFD additionally. The same warning appearsif the flaps move into position LDG (fully extended) while the gear is retracted.
DA 42 AFM Airplane Description
Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 7 - 15
To test the gear warning system (refer to 4A.6.1 - PRE-FLIGHT INSPECTION) push thetest button close by the gear selector switch. The aural gear alert should appear.
CAUTIONIf the aural alert does not appear, an unscheduledmaintenance is necessary.
To prevent inadvertent gear retraction on ground, an electric squat switch prevents thehydraulic valve from switching if the master switch is on and the gear extension switchis placed in the UP position.
After take-off, the gear should be retracted before an airspeed of 156 KIAS is exceeded.The landing gear may be extended at any speed up to 194 KIAS.
The landing gear is designed to be manually operated in the event of failure. Since thegear is held in the retracted position by hydraulic pressure, gravity will allow the gear toextend if the system fails for any reason. To extend and lock the gears in the event offailure, it is only necessary to relieve the hydraulic pressure by means of the emergencygear extension lever, which is located under the instrument panel to the left of the centerconsole. Pulling this lever releases the hydraulic pressure and allows the gear to fall free.Before pulling the emergency gear extension lever, place the gear selector switch in theDOWN position.
NOTEIf the emergency gear extension has been pulled due to anemergency, the system has to be checked before pushingthe lever in again.
The nose gear is steerable by the use of full rudder pedal travel. A gear damping element,incorporated in the nose gear steering system, prevents shimmy tendencies. When thegear is retracted, the nose wheel centers as it enters the wheel well, and the steeringlinkage disengages to reduce pedal loads in flight.

7.9.2  PROPELLER
Two mt-Propeller MTV-6-A-C-F/CF187-129 hydraulically regulated 3-bladed constantspeed feathering propellers are installed. Each propeller has wood composite blades withfiber-reinforced plastic coating and stainless steel edge cladding; in the region of thepropeller hub the leading edge is coated with adhesive PU foil. These blades combinethe lowest weight whilst minimizing vibration.
Propeller Control
The propeller pitch control system is integrated into the engine. The pitch is controlledautomatically by the ECU. To change the blade pitch angle gearbox oil is pumped intothe propeller hub. The oil pressure is regulated by an electrically operated valve, thegovernor valve, which is controlled by the ECU. Increasing the oil pressure leads to adecrease of pitch and a higher RPM. Decreasing the pressure leads to higher pitch anda lower RPM.
Depending on the power setting the propeller pitch is adjusted such that the required RPMwill be obtained as shown in the following diagram.
Airplane Description DA 42 AFM
Page 7 - 30 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
Pressure Accumulator:
The pressure accumulator is a nitrogen oil type. It is connected to the gearbox oil circuitvia an electric valve at the accumulator, which is operated with the ENGINE MASTERswitch.
When the ENGINE MASTER switch is set to ON the valve is opened. When the engineis running, the accumulator is filled with oil at a pressure of approximately 20 bar (290 PSI).During engine operation the accumulator makes sure that enough oil pressure is availableeven if the oil feed by the gearbox oil pump is decreasing due to negative acceleration.The hydraulic pressure keeps the propeller pitch angle below the start lock position, ormoves the propeller blades beyond the start lock position.
Feathering:
To feather the propeller the engine must be shut down with the appropriate ENGINEMASTER switch. This will open the electric governor valve. All oil will flow back from thepropeller hub, allowing the blades to move into the feathered pitch position. At the sametime the electric valve at the pressure accumulator closes, and the oil pressure is restoredin the accumulator. 
Feathering is only possible at propeller speeds above 1300 RPM.
CAUTIONIf the engine is shut down below an RPM of 1300 the propellerpitch remains below the start lock position. In this case thespeed must be increased to increase the propeller RPM.
DA 42 AFM Airplane Description
Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 7 - 31
Unfeathering:
To unfeather the propeller, the associated ENGINE MASTER switch must be set to ON.This will open the electric valve at the pressure accumulator. The pressure stored in theaccumulator will move the propeller blades into a low pitch position. As soon as thepropeller starts turning and the gearbox oil operates, the accumulator will be refilled.
Ground Operation:
CAUTIONOperation on the ground at high RPM should be avoided asfar as possible, as the blades could suffer stone damage. Forthis reason a suitable site for engine runs should be selected,where there are no loose stones or similar items.
WARNINGNever move the propeller by hand.

Page 7 - 32 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
7.9.3  OPERATING CONTROLS
POWER Lever
Engine performance is controlled by a power lever for each engine. Both power leversare situated on the large center console. 'Front' and 'rear' are defined in relation to thedirection of flight.
Each power lever is used to set the desired engine power LOAD (%)
Lever forward (MAX) = Full power
Lever to rear (IDLE) = Idle
A separate ECU for each engine controls manifold pressure, injected fuel quantity andpropeller speed according to the desired engine power preselected with the power lever.If the power lever is in a low power position - as for a landing approach - while the landinggear is retracted, an aural warning alerts the pilot to the retracted landing gear. If installeda CHECK GEAR caution is indicated on the PFD additionally.
A propeller governor, which is controlled by the ECU, is flanged onto the front of eachengine. The propeller governor oil circuit is supplied with oil by the gearbox oil pump (alsosee Section 7.9.2 - PROPELLER). A loss of oil pressure leads to a feathering of thepropeller blades, thus allowing continuation of the flight according to 3.9.3 - DEFECTIVEPROPELLER RPM REGULATING SYSTEM.
CAUTIONFollowing governor failure the RPM should be adjusted usingthe power lever. Every effort should be made not to exceed2300 RPM.
DA 42 AFM Airplane Description
Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 7 - 33
CAUTIONThe power lever should be moved slowly, in order to avoidover-speeding and excessively rapid RPM changes. The lightwooden propeller blades produce more rapid RPM changesthan metal blades.
WARNINGIt is possible that the propeller blades remain in the positionof highest pitch in case of a malfunction of the engine controlunit. In this case the reduced engine performance should betaken into consideration.
ELECT. MASTER
The electric master switch has two positions:
OFF disconnecting battery power
ON connecting battery power to the power distribution system
ENGINE MASTER
Each engine can only be cranked with its ENGINE MASTER switched to ON. Whenactivated, the ENGINE MASTER provides the power supply for the preheat system, theunfeathering accumulator valve and the engine itself. To shut down the engine theappropriate ENGINE MASTER is switched to OFF.

START
Turning START key switch to the left starts the LH engine. Turning it to the right side startsthe RH engine.
ECU SWAP
There are two ECU SWAP switches, one for each engine. For normal operation bothswitches are set to AUTOMATIC. Each engine is controlled by its ECU A. In case of afailure of the active engine control unit (ECU) there should be an automatic switch-overto the appropriate ECU B. If the automatic switch over fails, switch over can be donemanually by switching to ECU B. This procedure should only be applied in an emergency.
ECU TEST
There are two ECU TEST buttons, one for each engine. Depending on the position ofthe power lever and the engine speed, the ECU TEST button has two different functions.
Power lever at IDLE and RPM below approximately 900:
By pushing and holding the button until the end of the procedure, the self-test of eachengine control unit is started. The procedure is possible on the ground as well as duringflight, but only if the power lever is in the IDLE position. Otherwise the test will not start.During the procedure the ECU performs a switch from ECU A to ECU B with thepropeller cycling. The propeller RPM is monitored automatically by the ECU. Whenswitching from one ECU to the other, a slight shake of the engine may occur. Finallythe ECU switches back from ECU B to ECU A. After that both caution lights mustextinguish and the engine must run without a change.
Power lever above IDLE, or RPM above approximately 900:
If an ECU A or ECU B caution message is displayed, the ECU TEST button can bepressed for more than 2 seconds to reset the message. The reset is possible only once,and only in case of system faults of minor criticality.

Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 7 - 39
Fuel is stored in the tanks which are located in the wings.
Normally fuel for the right engine is taken from the right wing main tank and for the leftengine from the left wing main tank.
On each engine fuel is injected with high pressure directly into the cylinders. The injectionnozzles (one per cylinder) are supplied with fuel by the common rail. Pressure inside therail is generated by a high pressure pump which receives fuel from a low pressure pump.Depending on the power setting the rail pressure is controlled by the ECU through anelectric valve. Both pumps are powered mechanically by the engine. Fuel that is notinjected is fed back into the appropriate wing tank.
Both sides of the fuel system are interconnected by crossfeed lines. 
In each engine nacelle an auxiliary fuel tank may be installed (OÃ„M 42-056 carried out).

Page 7 - 40 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
Fuel Selector Valves
For each engine one fuel selector valve is provided. The control levers for the fuel selectorvalves are situated on the center console behind the power levers. The positions are ON,CROSSFEED and OFF. During normal operation each engine takes the fuel from thetank on the same side as the engine. When CROSSFEED is selected, the engine willdraw fuel from the tank on the opposite side in order to extend range and keep fuel weightbalanced during single engine operation. With the fuel selector valve both the feedingand the return line are switched.
The desired position is reached by pulling the lever back. To reach the OFF position asafety guard must be twisted. This is to ensure that this selection is not madeunintentionally.
NOTEIf one engine is inoperative the fuel selector valve for thisengine must be in the OFF position.
CAUTIONDo not operate with both fuel selector valves in CROSSFEEDposition. Do not take-off with a fuel selector valve inCROSSFEED position.
CAUTIONDo not shut down an engine with the fuel selector valve. Thehigh pressure fuel pump can otherwise be damaged.

Main Fuel Tanks
Each tank consists of three aluminum chambers which are connected by a flexible hose.The tank is filled through a filler in the outboard fuel chamber. Only four liter (1 US gal)of fuel in each wing are unusable, so that a total quantity of 94.6 liter (25 US gal) in eachwing is usable.
There are two tank vents. One includes a check valve with a capillary and one includesa relief pressure valve, which operates at 150 mbar (2 PSI) and allows fuel and air to flowto the outside with higher internal pressure. The relief pressure valve protects the tankagainst high pressure, if the tank was overfilled in case of an auxiliary fuel transfer failure.The check valve with capillary allows air to enter the tank but prevents flow of fuel to theoutside. The capillary equalizes the air pressure during climb. The hose terminals arelocated on the underside of the wing, approximately 2 m (7 ft) from the wing tip.
In each tank a coarse filter (finger filter) is fitted before the outlet. To allow draining ofthe tank, there is an outlet valve at its lowest point.
At the lowest point in each side of the fuel system a fuel filter with a drain valve is installed.This drain valve can be used to remove water and sediment which has collected in thefuel system. The drain valves are fitted in each nacelle behind the firewall, approximately15 cm (0.56 ft) backward of the wing leading edge.
Fuel Quantity Indication
Two capacity probes measure the fuel quantity in each main tank. The indication isprovided by the G1000 flight display. Information about fuel consumption can be foundin Chapter 5 - PERFORMANCE.

Page 7 - 44 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
Auxiliary Fuel Tanks (if installed)
The auxiliary fuel tanks are optional equipment (OÃ„M 42-056).
Description
The auxiliary fuel tanks are installed in the rear section of the engine nacelles, above thewing main spars. Each auxiliary fuel tank has a filler cap located on the top surface ofthe nacelle. The additional fuel capacity is 52 liter (13.7 US gal) per side. The total fuelcapacity (main fuel tanks and auxiliary fuel tanks) is 150.4 liter (39.7 US gal) per side.
The fuel supply connection attaches to a finger filter mounted at the rear of the auxiliaryfuel tank. Each auxiliary fuel tank has a fuel transfer pump which pumps fuel into therelated main fuel tank. Upstream of the fuel transfer pump an inline filter, a solenoid valveand a check valve are installed. The valves prevent fuel from flowing back out of the maintank into the auxiliary tank.
The vent line for the auxiliary fuel tank has a check valve with capillary. It allows air toenter the tank but prevents flow of fuel to the outside. The capillary equalizes the airpressure during climb. A fuel drain valve is located at the rear of each auxiliary tank.
Operation
Two FUEL TRANSFER switches in the cockpit are used to activate the fuel transfer pumpsand to open the solenoid valves. The switches are located behind the elevator trim wheelon the center console. Both switches are intended to be used simultaneously to preventthe airplane from additional lateral imbalance. The fuel transfer pump pumps the fuel fromthe auxiliary fuel tank into the related main fuel tank. Fuel level switches shut this pumpand the related solenoid valves off automatically, if the auxiliary fuel tank is empty or ifthe main fuel tank is full. During operation of the pumps an advisory alert on the GarminG1000 indicates that the fuel transfer is in progress.
If the auxiliary fuel tank is empty, a caution alert appears on the Garmin G1000. In thiscase the fuel pumps must be switched OFF.

Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 7 - 45
When one fuel transfer pump is defective, the fuel stored in the related auxiliary fuel tankis not available. For use of the remaining fuel pump refer to Section 4B.11 - L/R FUELTRANSFER FAIL. The flight plan must be amended accordingly.
The fuel transfer pumps and the solenoid valves are electrically connected to the LH mainbus and protected by a 5 A or 7.5 A circuit breaker, if no ice protection system(OÃ„M 42-053) is installed. 
Otherwise the fuel transfer pumps and the ice protection system (OÃ„M 42-053) areprotected by a 10 A circuit breaker. The fuel transfer pumps are additionally protectedby a 7 A inline fuse.

Alternate Means for Fuel QuantityIndication for the Fuel Tank:
The alternate means for fuel quantityindication allows the fuel quantity in thetank to be determined during the preflightinspection. It functions according to theprinciple of communicating containers.The fuel quantity measuring device hasa recess which fits the airfoil of the wingin front of the fuel tank drain, which liesapproximately 10 cm (4 in) outboard ofthe engine nacelle. The metal connectoris pressed against the drain of the tank.The amount of fuel in the tank can nowbe read off from the vertical ascendingpipe.
For an exact indication the airplane muststand on level ground and the measuringdevice must be held vertically.
The designated location for the fuelquantity measuring device is a bag on therear side of the pilot seat.

Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 7 - 47
Fuel Temperature
A fuel temperature sensor measures the fuel temperature in each main tank. The indicationis provided by the G1000 flight display. Information about fuel temperature limitationscan be found in Chapter 2 - OPERATING LIMITATIONS.
The lower yellow bar indicates that the airplane is not ready for take-off if Diesel Fuel ora blend of Diesel Fuel with Jet Fuel is used (approved only if MÃ„M 42-037 is incorporated).If the fuel grade is uncertain, take-off is not allowed in this temperature range either.
In the temperature range below -5 Â°C (23 Â°F) the engine must not be started if Diesel Fuelor a blend of Diesel Fuel with Jet Fuel is used. If the fuel blend is uncertain, the enginemust not be started in this temperature range either.
If the airplane is being operated with Jet Fuel, operation in the yellow temperature rangeis permissible.
Fuel Grade
Approved fuel grades are listed in Section 2.14 - FUEL. As the fuel grade is importantconcerning operating temperature limitations, the pilot must be sure about the fuel grade.Cold Diesel Fuel tends to flocculate, which can lead to clogging of the fuel filter. The fuelfilter is not heated.
If the airplane is operated in a cold environment, it must be changed from Diesel Fueloperation to Jet Fuel operation. To ensure that no blend of Jet Fuel with Diesel Fuel isin one of the tanks, each tank must be refilled at least twice with more than 65 liter(17.2 US gal) of Jet Fuel. Otherwise both tanks must be drained before refueling withJet Fuel.
Airplane Description DA 42 AFM
Page 7 - 48 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
NOTEIn order to provide information about the fuel grade it isrecommended to enter the fuel grade in the airplane log eachtime fuel is refilled.
CAUTIONIf the airplane is operated with Diesel Fuel or a blend of DieselFuel with Jet Fuel the use of the auxiliary tanks, if installed(OÃ„M 42-056), is not permitted.

7.9.6  COOLING SYSTEM
Each engine is liquid cooled. The liquid cooling system consists of a radiator and a bypassto this radiator. The bypass is in operation when coolant temperatures are low. It thereforeallows the engine to warm-up quickly. Upon reaching a certain temperature (approximately88 Â°C or 190 Â°F) the radiator is activated by a thermostat valve. Additionally a coolantto air heat exchanger is provided for the cabin heat system. The flow through the heatexchanger is independent of the coolant temperature. An expansion tank helps to adjustthe pressure in the system. The system is protected against over pressure by means ofa pressure relief valve.
Airplane Description DA 42 AFM
Page 7 - 50 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
7.9.7  OIL SYSTEMS
Each engine has two separate oil systems.
Lubrication System (Engine and Turbo-Charger)
The engine lubrication is a wet sump lubrication system. The oil is cooled by a separatecooler on the underside of the engine.
A dip-stick is provided to check the oil quantity through an inspection hole in the uppercowling. If required, oil can also be filled in there (for approved oil grades refer to Section2.4 - POWER-PLANT LIMITATIONS).
Gearbox and Propeller Governor System
The second oil circuit lubricates the gearbox and serves the governor system and theregulation of the propeller.
The gearbox oil quantity can be checked with the help of an inspection glass which canbe reached through an inspection hole on the front side of the lower cowling.
CAUTIONIf the gearbox oil quantity is too low, an unscheduledmaintenance is necessary (for approved oil grades refer toSection 2.4 - POWER-PLANT LIMITATIONS).

7.9.8  TURBO-CHARGER SYSTEM
The exhaust system contains a manifold which collects exhaust gases from the outletsof the cylinders and feeds them to the turbine of the turbo charger. Behind the turbinethe exhaust gases are guided through the lower cowling to the exterior of the airplane.Excess exhaust gases bypass the turbine. The bypass is controlled by the ECU throughthe waste gate valve. A manifold pressure sensor behind the compressor allows the ECUto calculate the correct position of the waste gate valve. This prevents excessive manifoldpressures at low density altitudes. The intake air is compressed in the compressor whichis driven by the turbine, and is subsequently cooled down in the intercooler to increasepower. Cooling the air increases efficiency through the higher density of the cooler air.

7.10 ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
Airplane Description DA 42 AFM
Page 7 - 54 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
7.10.1  GENERAL
The DA 42 has 28 Volt DC system, which can be sub-divided into:
- Power generation- Storage- Distribution- Consumers
Power Generation
Power generation is provided by two 60 AmpÃ¨re alternators (generators) which aremounted on the bottom left side of each engine. The alternators are driven by a flat belt.
The power output line of the left hand alternator is connected to the LH MAIN BUS viathe LH alternator relay and a 70 AmpÃ¨re circuit breaker. The power output line of the RHalternator is connected to the RH MAIN BUS via the RH alternator relay and a 70 AmpÃ¨recircuit breaker. Both main busses are connected to the BATTERY BUS via a 90 AmpÃ¨recircuit breaker.
Both generator power output lines also run through a current sensor for each alternator,which provides an indication of the power being supplied to the electrical system by analternator including the current for battery charging on the G1000. In the event of a mainbattery failure the field of each alternator is energized by two 12 V, 1.3 Ah sealed leadacid batteries (excitation battery) connected in series, which are installed in the nosebaggage compartment. The ENGINE MASTER LH (RH) switches connect the excitationbattery to the alternator field via a 5 AmpÃ¨re fuse.
If MÃ„M 42-240 or OÃ„M 42-074 or OÃ„M 42-129 are carried out:
The ENGINE MASTER LH (RH) switches connect the excitation battery to the alternatorfield via a 10 AmpÃ¨re fuse.
DA 42 AFM Airplane Description
Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 7 - 55
Alternator Control:
Each alternator has an alternator control unit. It measures the alternator output voltageand controls the current through the alternator field coils via a pulse-width modulatedsignal. To keep the output voltage stable in all load and speed situations, the alternatorfield signal is modulated accordingly.
The alternator control unit includes a comprehensive set of diagnostic functions that willwarn the operator using a caution message (L/R ALTN FAIL) on the G1000 PFD in caseof over- or undervoltage as well as a couple of other internal warning levels.
Load balancing: The alternator control unit supports load balancing across the twoalternators via the internal alternator temperature. The temperature is measured and thealternator control unit slightly decreases alternator voltage output at higher internalalternator temperatures. Thus the load is partly shifted to the alternator with the lowerinternal temperature. This system is able to balance the actual load within a few ampsbetween the two alternators installed.
Storage
Main battery power is stored in a 24 V, 10 Ah lead-acid battery mounted on the right-aftside of the front baggage compartment. The main battery is connected to the HOTBATTERY BUS and to the BATTERY BUS via the battery relay which is installed in therelay junction box on the center-aft side of the front baggage compartment.
The battery relay is controlled with the ELECTRIC MASTER switch which is located onthe left-hand side of the instrument panel.
In addition, a non-rechargeable dry battery is installed as a further source of power forthe attitude gyro (artificial horizon) and the flood light. When the EMERGENCY switchis set to ON, these two systems are supplied with power for at least 1.5 hours, independentof all other electrical consumers. During each 100 hour inspection, this battery is checkedfor proper functioning. Every 2 years or after use (broken seal on the switch) the batterypackage must be replaced.
Airplane Description DA 42 AFM
Page 7 - 56 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
Distribution
Electrical power is distributed via the HOT BATTERY BUS, the BATTERY BUS, the LH(RH) ECU BUS, the LH (RH) MAIN BUS, and the AVIONIC BUS.
HOT BATTERY BUS:
The HOT BATTERY BUS is directly connected to the MAIN BATTERY and cannot bedisconnected from the MAIN BATTERY. The HOT BATTERY BUS provides power tothe pilot map/reading light and ELT RCPI unit which are protected by there own fuses.
BATTERY BUS:
The BATTERY BUS is connected to the main battery via the battery relay which can becontrolled by the ELECTRIC MASTER switch. The BATTERY BUS provides power tothe LH (RH) MAIN BUS and heavy duty power to both starters.
ECU BUS:
The LH (RH) ECU BUS is connected to the LH (RH) MAIN BUS via a diode and connectedto the power output line of the alternator via diode and a 30 AmpÃ¨re circuit breaker andprovides power for the ECU A and ECU B via the LH (RH) ECU A (B) relays which arecontrolled by the LH (RH) ENGINE MASTER switch. The LH (RH) ENGINE MASTERswitch must be set to ON to connect the ECU A and ECU B to the ECU BUS.
To support the alternator electrical power supply to the ECUs in case of a malfunctionof the main battery, additional sealed-lead-acid batteries (ECU backup battery) areconnected to the RH and LH ECU BUS. 
If OÃ„M 42-129 is carried out:
These batteries are able to provide 30 minutes of engine operation in case of a completeairplane electrical failure. Both engines may stop if the 30 minutes have elapsed.
DA 42 AFM Airplane Description
Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 7 - 57
MAIN BUS:
The LH (RH) MAIN BUS is connected to the BATTERY BUS via a 90 AmpÃ¨re circuitbreaker. The LH MAIN BUS provides power to the consumers directly connected to theLH MAIN BUS. The RH MAIN BUS provides power to the consumers directly connectedto the RH MAIN BUS and the AVIONIC BUS via the AVIONICS MASTER relay.
The AVIONIC MASTER switch must be set to ON to connect the RH MAIN BUS to theAVIONIC BUS.
Consumers
The individual consumers (e.g. radio, position lights, etc.) are connected to the appropriatebus via automatic circuit breakers.
Designations and abbreviations used to identify the circuit breakers are explained inSection 1.5 - DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS.
Voltmeter
The voltmeter displays the voltage of the electrical system. Under normal operatingconditions the alternator voltage is shown, otherwise it displays the main battery voltage.
Ammeter
The ammeter displays the intensity of current which is supplied to the electrical systemby the LH (RH) alternator.
Landing and Taxi Lights
Landing and taxi lights are built into the wing center section, and are each operated bymeans of a switch (LANDING, TAXI) located on the row of switches on the instrumentpanel.
Airplane Description DA 42 AFM
Page 7 - 58 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
Position and Strobe Lights
Combined position and strobe lights (anti collision lights) are installed on both wing tips.Each system is operated by a switch (POSITION, STROBE) located on the row of switcheson the instrument panel.
Flood Light
A two-dimensional light emitter is mounted above the instrument panel. It illuminates theinstrument panel as well as all levers, switches, etc. The flood light is switched on andits brightness is adjusted by means of a rotary button (FLOOD) in the LH section of theinstrument panel.
Instrument Lighting
With a rotary button (INSTRUMENT) in the LH section of the instrument panel the internallighting of the instruments is switched on and its brightness is adjusted.
Pitot Heating
The Pitot probe, which provides measurement for the Pitot-static system, is electricallyheated. The heating is activated with a switch (PITOT HEAT) located on the row ofswitches on the instrument panel. The temperature is automatically kept constant bymeans of a thermal switch on the Pitot probe, and as an additional safety measure athermal fuse is built in. If this thermal fuse is activated, the Pitot heating can no longerbe switched on, and the PITOT HT fail will be displayed. In this case the system shouldbe serviced. The PITOT HT OFF is on if the Pitot heating is switched off.

Sensors installed are:
- Oil temperature (lubrication system engine) / OIL TEMP- Oil pressure (lubrication system engine) / OIL PRES
- Coolant temperature / COOLANT TEMP- Gearbox temperature / GEARBOX- Camshaft RPM (twice)- Crankshaft RPM (twice)- Fuel pressure in the common rail- Manifold pressure- Manifold air temperature- Ambient air pressure- Propeller governor / oil pressure- Power lever position (twice)- Voltage- Starter switch signal- Fuel pressure- ECU SWAP switch signal- ECU TEST switch signal
DA 42 AFM Airplane Description
Doc. No. 7.01.05-E Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Page 7 - 61
In accordance with the received signals and a comparison with the programmedcharacteristic diagrams the necessary inputs are calculated and transmitted by thefollowing signal lines to the engine:
- Activation of starter (relay)- Signal for propeller governor pressure valve- Signal for the rail-pressure regulation valve- Signal for each of the 4 injection nozzles - Activation of the glow plugs- Signal for the waste gate valve
The following alerts are displayed on PFD of the G1000:
- Glow sparks active- Status ECU A- Status ECU B
Normally each engine is controlled and regulated by the appropriate ECU A. The ECU Bis a backup system to ensure redundancy. In case of an internal error during operationor the loss of a sensor signal the system automatically switches to ECU B. If the loss ofthe sensor signal was the cause for the error, the system automatically switches backto ECU A.
A fault in one of the ECUs is indicated by a caution message on the PFD (L/R ECU A/BFAIL). In case of minor faults, the annunciation can be reset once by pressing the ECUTEST button for more than 2 seconds. However, the annunciation will re-appear uponthe next attempt to start the engine. After the indication of the L/R ECU A/B FAIL cautionmessage, the engine must be serviced, even if the caution message could be reset.

7.10.3  WARNING, CAUTION AND ADVISORY MESSAGES
Crew Alerting System (CAS)
The G1000 Crew Alerting System (CAS) is designed to provide visual and aural alertsto the flight crew. Alerts are divided into three levels as follows:
WARNING
CAUTION
ADVISORYCrew alerts will appear in the Alerts Window on the PFD. In this window warnings willappear at the top, followed by cautions and advisories, respectively. Within the criticalitylevels, messages will appear from newest (top) to oldest (bottom). 
At the low right corner of the display there is a MSG (message) soft key. The MSG keyprovides two functions in the CAS:
1. Pressing the MSG key acknowledges a new master warning / caution / advisoryindication.
2. An additional MSG key press with no master alert indication active will open a pop-upAuxiliary Flight Display (AFD) page that contains information for all active alerts.
This structure allows the crew to scroll through all system alerts if the Alerts Windowoverflows. This approach displays the most critical alerts close to the pilotâ€™s primary fieldof view at all times, with the option of allowing lower criticality alerts to overflow and beaccessible from the pop-up AFD page/window.

The Primary Flight Display (PFD; see Figure below) typically displays airspeed, attitude,altitude, and heading information in a traditional format. Slip information is shown as atrapezoid under the bank pointer. One width of the trapezoid is equal to a one ball widthslip. Rate of turn information is shown on the scale above the compass rose; full scaledeflection is equal to a standard rate turn. The following controls are available on the PFD(clockwise from top right):
* Communications frequency volume and squelch knob* Communications frequency set knobs* Communications frequency transfer button* Altimeter setting knob (baro set)* Course knob* Map range knob and cursor control* FMS control buttons and knob* PFD softkey buttons, including master warning/caution acknowledgment* Altitude reference set knob* Heading bug control* Navigation frequency transfer button* Navigation frequency set knobs* Navigation frequency volume and Identifier knob

Page 7 - 72 Rev. 8 15-Dec-2017 Doc. No. 7.01.05-E
Advisory messages related to G1000 system status are shown in white and areaccompanied by a white flashing ADVISORY alert. Refer to the G1000 Pilot*s Guide andCockpit Reference Guide for descriptions of the messages and recommended actions(if applicable).
Trend vectors are shown on the airspeed and altimeter displays as a magenta linepredicting 6 seconds at the current rate. The turn rate indicator also functions as a trendindicator on the compass scale.
The PFD can be displayed in a composite format for emergency use by pressing theDISPLAY BACKUP button on the audio panel. In the composite mode, the full crew alertingfunction remains, but no map functions are available.
7.13.3  MULTI-FUNCTION DISPLAY (MFD)
The Multi-Function Display (MFD) typically displays engine data, maps, terrain, trafficand topography displays, and flight planning and progress information. The display unitis identical to the PFD and contains the same controls as previously listed.
Engine instruments are displayed on the MFD. Discrete engine sensor information isprocessed by the Garmin Engine Airframe (GEA) sub-system. When an engine sensorindicates a value outside the normal operating range, the legend will turn yellow for cautionrange, and turn red and flash for warning range.
Also refer to Section 7.9.4 - ENGINE INSTRUMENTS.

7.13.4  AUDIO PANEL
The audio panel contains traditional transmitter and receiver selectors, as well as anintegral intercom and marker beacon system. The marker beacon lights appear on thePFD. In addition, a clearance recorder records the last 2 Â½ minutes of received audio.Lights above the selections indicate what selections are active. Pressing the red DISPLAYBACKUP button on the audio panel causes both the PFD and MFD to display a compositemode.
7.13.5  ATTITUDE AND HEADING REFERENCE SYSTEM (AHRS)
The Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) uses GPS, rate sensors, air data,and magnetic variation to determine pitch and roll attitude, sideslip and heading. Operationis possible in a degraded mode if the system loses any of these inputs. Status messagesalert the crew of the loss of any of these inputs. The AHRS will align while the airplaneis in motion, but will align quicker if the wings are kept level during the alignment process.
7.13.6  AIR DATA COMPUTER (ADC)
The Air Data Computer (ADC) provides airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, and airtemperature to the display system. In addition to the primary displays, this informationis used by the FMS and TIS systems.
7.13.7 GWX 68 WEATHER RADAR
The Garmin GWX 68 Weather Radar System provides information about precipitationconditions ahead of the airplane. The system consists of a combined microwave transmitterand receiver system in the nose cone, mounted to the front baggage compartmentbulkhead. The system is connected to the electrical system of the airplane via a circuitbreaker on the instrument panel. The processed data of the GWX 68 system is displayedon the Garmin G1000 MFD.

7.14 STRUCTURAL TEMPERATURE INDICATOR
If OÃ„M 42-188 is carried out a structural temperature indicator, installed in the LH andRH main landing gear bay (see Figure below) indicates when the structural temperaturelimitation is exceeded (refer to Section 2.16.10). The indicator needs to be checked if thezero fuel mass exceeds 1650 kg (3638 lb).
At temperatures below the 55Â°C (131Â°F) limit, the indicator appears all red with a faintindication of "55" (Â°C). At temperatures exceeding the 55Â°C (131Â°F) limit, the indicatordisplays a clearly contrasting red "55" (Â°C) on a black background (see Figure below).
NOTEAt temperatures approaching the limit, the background willprogressively darken prior to turning black; this indicatesacceptable temperatures.
A red "55" on black background indicates that the structural temperature limit is exceeded.In this case the maximum zero fuel mass is 1650 kg (3638 lb):

CAUTIONIf the airplane is towed by steering / tow bar by hand or a tow%vehicle, do not turn the nose wheel more than 40 degreesto either side from the center position. Otherwise damage tothe torque links of the nose landing gear will result.%
When towing the airplane with a tow vehicle, a qualified person must sit in the cockpitready for immediate braking action, in the event that the tow vehicle becomes uncoupled.The movement of the tow vehicle should always be started and stopped slowly to avoidshock loads on the nose landing gear. The maximum steering angle of 40 degrees to eitherside must not be exceeded.
WARNINGThe tow bar must be removed before starting the engine.
If the airplane must be pulled out of soft ground or deep snow, towing lines must be used.The towing lines should be attached to the main landing gear struts as high as possiblewithout interfering with the brake lines. The ropes should be long enough to sufficientlyclear the nose or tail. A qualified person must sit in the cockpit to maintain control of theairplane using the nose wheel steering and brakes.
WARNINGAll towing lines must be removed before starting the engines.

8.6 CLEANING AND CARE
CAUTIONThe airplane must be kept clean. The bright surface preventsthe structure from overheating.
CAUTIONExcessive dirt deteriorates the flight performance.
8.6.1  PAINTED SURFACES
The entire surface of the airplane is painted with a white weatherproof two componentpaint. Nevertheless, it is recommended to protect the airplane against moisture anddampness. It is also recommended not to store the airplane outside for long periods oftime.
Dirt, insects, etc. can be removed with water alone and if necessary with a mild detergent.An automotive paint cleaner can be used for stubborn spots. For best results, clean theairplane after the day's flying is ended, so that the dirt will not become ingrained.
Oil stains, exhaust stains, etc. on the lower fuselage skin can be removed with a colddetergent. Before starting, ensure that the detergent does not affect the surface finish.Use commercial automotive preservatives without silicone additives to conserve the paintfinish.
8.6.2  CANOPY AND REAR DOOR
The canopy, rear door and rear window should be cleaned with 'Plexiklar' or any otheracrylic glass detergent if available; otherwise use lukewarm water. Final cleaning shouldbe carried out with a clean piece of chamois leather or soft cloth. Never rub or polish dryacrylic glass.
