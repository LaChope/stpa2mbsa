7.9.5 FUEL SYSTEM

Main Fuel Tanks

Each tank consists of three aluminum chambers which are connected by a flexible hose. The tank is filled through a filler in the outboard fuel chamber. Only four liter (1 US gal) of fuel in each wing are unusable, so that a total quantity of 94.6 liter (25 US gal) in each wing is usable.

There are two tank vents. One includes a check valve with a capillary and one includes a relief pressure valve, which operates at 150 mbar (2 PSI) and allows fuel and air to flow to the outside with higher internal pressure. The relief pressure valve protects the tank against high pressure, if the tank was overfilled in case of an auxiliary fuel transfer failure. The check valve with capillary allows air to enter the tank but prevents flow of fuel to the outside. The capillary equalizes the air pressure during climb. The hose terminals are located on the underside of the wing, approximately 2 m (7 ft) from the wing tip.

In each tank a coarse filter (finger filter) is fitted before the outlet. To allow draining of the tank, there is an outlet valve at its lowest point.

At the lowest point in each side of the fuel system a fuel filter with a drain valve is installed. This drain valve can be used to remove water and sediment which has collected in the fuel system. The drain valves are fitted in each nacelle behind the firewall, approximately 15 cm (0.56 ft) backward of the wing leading edge.
