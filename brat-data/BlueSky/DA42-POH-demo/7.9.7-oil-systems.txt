7.9.7 OIL SYSTEMS

Each engine has two separate oil systems.


Lubrication System (Engine and Turbo-Charger)

The engine lubrication is a wet sump lubrication system. The oil is cooled by a separate cooler on the underside of the engine.

A dip-stick is provided to check the oil quantity through an inspection hole in the upper cowling. If required, oil can also be filled in there (for approved oil grades refer to Section 2.4 - POWER-PLANT LIMITATIONS).


Gearbox and Propeller Governor System

The second oil circuit lubricates the gearbox and serves the governor system and the regulation of the propeller. The gearbox oil quantity can be checked with the help of an inspection glass which can be reached through an inspection hole on the front side of the lower cowling.
