7.9.8 TURBO-CHARGER SYSTEM

The exhaust system contains a manifold which collects exhaust gases from the outlets of the cylinders and feeds them to the turbine of the turbo charger. Behind the turbine the exhaust gases are guided through the lower cowling to the exterior of the airplane. Excess exhaust gases bypass the turbine. The bypass is controlled by the ECU through the waste gate valve. A manifold pressure sensor behind the compressor allows the ECU to calculate the correct position of the waste gate valve. This prevents excessive manifold pressures at low density altitudes. The intake air is compressed in the compressor which is driven by the turbine, and is subsequently cooled down in the intercooler to increase power. Cooling the air increases efficiency through the higher density of the cooler air.
