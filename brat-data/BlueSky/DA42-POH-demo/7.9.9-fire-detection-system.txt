7.9.9 FIRE DETECTION SYSTEM

The fire detection system in the DA 42 consists of an overheat detector in the hot area of each engine. In case of an increase of the engine compartment temperature above 250 °C (480 °F) the overheat detector closes the electric circuit and a warning message appears in the annunciation window of the G1000 PFD.

To test the fire detectors (refer to Section 4A.6.1 - PREFLIGHT INSPECTION) push the test button located next to the gear selector switch. An aural alert and the fire warning message for the LH and RH engine should appear in the annunciation window of the G1000 PFD.


CAUTION

If the aural alert or the warning does not appear, an unscheduled maintenance is necessary.
