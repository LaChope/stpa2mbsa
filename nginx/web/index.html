<h1>LTACH19032 project demo</h1>

    <p class="description">This is demo of project
        <a href="https://starfos.tacr.cz/en/project/LTACH19032?query_code=5yiyaackalka">
            Ontology engineering utilization in reliability and quality knowledge management systems in the aviation
        </a>
        funded by
        <a href="https://www.msmt.cz/">MŠMT</a>
	within programme INTER-EXCELLENCE. The project was focused on development of a knowledge management system in air transport with utilization of ontology engineering in the domain. The goal of the project was application of quality and reliability conceptual modeling to represent knowledge and correlations in quality and reliability data. 
    </p>
    <p>The demo consist of two integrated tools. The Annotator tool is used to annotate documents (e.g. an airplain flight manual), which can be then imported to the tool used for reliability analysis of hardware systems by means of Fault-tree Analysis (FTA) and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). You can navigate to the mentioned tools with following links:</p>
